				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among the latest in &lt;a href=&quot;https://cni.iisc.ac.in/covid-19-response/&quot;&gt;CNI’s contributions towards COVID-19 response&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iitm.ac.in/&quot;&gt;Indian Institute of Technology Madras&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iitm.ac.in/&quot;&gt;Centre for Networked Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iisc.ac.in/&quot;&gt;Indian Institute of Science (IISc)&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.isical.ac.in/&quot;&gt;Indian Statistical Institute&lt;/a&gt; (ISI) are collaborating with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.semanticwebindia.com/index.html#extHeader5-6i&quot;&gt;Semantic Web&lt;/a&gt; India, a private technology firm based in Bangalore, to continue the efforts of a critical COVID-19 Data Website. 
&lt;img src=&quot;http://10.32.199.46:4003/cni-website/images/posts/screenshot-2021-11-24-213945-1536x768.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; 
&lt;a href=&quot;www.covid19india.org&quot;&gt;www.covid19india.org&lt;/a&gt;  offered a comprehensive view on the pandemic across India by providing data on confirmed cases, active and recovered cases, tests and fatalities. The portal also recently started showing vaccination administration status for single-dose and fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website, which till now was run by volunteers based on a crowd-sourcing model, provided valuable data to the public as well as researchers studying the pandemic. &lt;strong&gt;The organisers  recently announced that they would stop their operations beyond 31st October 2021.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://10.32.199.46:4003/cni-website/images/posts/screenshot-2021-11-24-214123.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This new initiative of these Academic Institutions and Semantic Web India will now continue updating the data from 1st November 2021 and make it available at &lt;a href=&quot;www.incovid19.org&quot;&gt;www.incovid19.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>AADHAAR Hackathon 2021</title>
				<link>http://10.32.199.46:4003/cni-website/announcing-hackathon-2021/</link>
				<pubDate>Sat, 30 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We are excited to announce the Aadhaar Hackathon 2021, in partnership with the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hackathon, featuring unique challenges to solve regarding authentication and data registry update, is open to all engineering students in India. There are bountiful prizes to be won, too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please head over to &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackathon.uidai.gov.in/&quot;&gt;https://hackathon.uidai.gov.in&lt;/a&gt; for more details.

				<title>Cloud-based hands-on lab for Communication Networks</title>
				<link>http://10.32.199.46:4003/cni-website/cloud-based-hands-on-lab-for-communication-networks/</link>
				<pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ut est rerum omnium magister usus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Experience is the teacher of all things.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hands-on learning—learning by experimentation—is a great way to learn systems and networks. However, not everyone has access to a well-equipped lab (and COVID-19 has further restricted physical access to labs). Cloud computing and virtualisation has eased some of hardware resource requirements, but setting up a virtual lab environment takes significant effort and expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this Teachers’ day, we are delighted to announce the release of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://netlab.cnihackathon.in/&quot;&gt;cloud-based hands-on lab for Communication Networks&lt;/a&gt;. The software runs entirely on cloud, doing away with requirements to set up any software on a user’s computer. In addition to the lab environment, we have also put together self-learning course modules to recall key concepts (with links to Internet resources for learning the concepts), exercises, and code snippets to get started on complex exercises. The self-taught workflow is such that the learner is able to read the instructions as well as try out the examples in the lab console from the same browser window. Each user, after registration, is allocated a dedicated system resource to try out the exercises/experiments. The course content follows &lt;em&gt;executable book&lt;/em&gt; format (built using the excellent Jupyter-book project) to embed executable Python code within instructions. In addition, we’ve added system shell as well as a graphical desktop to access the system utilities needed for building, configuring, and programming networks.

&lt;p&gt;The lab platform is accessible at &lt;a href=&quot;https://netlab.cnihackathon.in/&quot;&gt;https://netlab.cnihackathon.in&lt;/a&gt;. We intend to keep updating/improving the lab based on your feedback. So, please give it a spin and let us know your feedback at &lt;a href=&quot;cni.iisc.netlab@gmail.com&quot;&gt;cni.iisc.netlab@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title:&lt;/strong&gt; Performance of TCP Controlled File Transfers over Infrastructure WiFi Networks: Insights into Network Effects&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Over the past two decades, WiFi has emerged as the default wireless access technology in offices, homes, universities, and industrial establishments. Over this period, the core WiFi standards have evolved through IEEE 802.11, 802.11b, 802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.11ac 802.11ax (soon to be ratified, and also called WiFi6), and the emerging 802.11be. Until IEEE 802.11n, opportunities for WiFi nodes to transmit over the wireless medium, have been controlled by the Distributed Coordination Function (DCF), the IEEE 802.11 implementation of CSMA/CA. IEEE 802.11ax and beyond now include OFDMA, but opportunities for nodes to access the wireless medium are still governed by DCF; once an access point (AP) gets access, it can transmit to or receive from multiple nodes by utilising OFDMA and multi-user MIMO. Over the past two to three decades, the Internet has become the ubiquitous technology for packet networking, agnostic to the physical communication technologies interconnecting the endpoints. The predominant transport protocol (in terms of volume of data carried) is TCP, and file transfer (either via HTTP or FTP) is a major application that runs over TCP.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This will be a tutorial level presentation of stochastic modeling that aims to provide insights into the performance of TCP controlled file transfers over WiFi and DCF, with the eventual goal of building an understanding of file transfer performance in multi-AP networks. We will begin the presentation from the now classic fixed-point model for saturated nodes in a single AP setting, and then describe models for predicting TCP controlled file transfer throughputs. Network effects will be brought in by showing the effects of channel errors (induced by co-channel interference), and by some simple models of interfering co-channel multi-AP networks. While the models will be largely developed for now “legacy” networks up to IEEE 802.11n, models for 11ac and 11ax networks can be built as extensions of the models we present, and we will provide insights into how this could be done.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title:&lt;/strong&gt; Connecting the Unconnected in 5G and Beyond&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In this talk, we review the challenges in connecting the unconnected and argue on rethinking the requirements of 5G and beyond systems. We propose an architecture called “Frugal 5G” for affordable broadband access and IEEE P2061. We discuss the architectural elements of Frugal 5G and its implementation within 3GPP 5G framework. Specifically, we present an OpenFlow based RAN architecture  which enables unified access control at the edge. Finally, we show how by using Software Defined Networking and Network function virtualization, we can realize the architecture for providing affordable connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
