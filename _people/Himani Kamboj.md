description: 
description2: Himani is an M.Tech (Communication and Networks) student in the ECE department. She is currently working on developing a 3GPP standard aligned prototype of a Cell-free Distributed MIMO system with Dynamic TDD using OpenAirInterface (OAI) codebase and Software-defined Radio (SDR). Cell-free Distributed MIMO system provides high spectral & energy efficiency, overcomes inter-cell interference, and increases coverage probability. Dynamic TDD gives more flexibility to the system and improves throughput. This makes a Cell-free Distributed MIMO system with Dynamic TDD suitable for next-generation indoor & hot-spot coverage scenarios and critical outdoor coverage scenarios.
