description: 
description2: Robin is an M.Tech student in ECE department. His areas of research are distributed optimization and he is currently working on ”Distributed Graph Signal Processing using Orthogonal Polynomial”. The work focuses on solving optimization problems in a distributed manner for scenarios without central processor. In this work we make use of orthogonal polynomials to accelerate the rate of convergence to the desired value and thereby obtaining a good approximate with less computations and communications. The major applications of the proposed technique are in denoising, semi-supervised learning, prediction, and other machine learning tasks on data that are distributed in nature.
