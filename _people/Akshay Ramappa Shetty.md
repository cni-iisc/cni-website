description: 
description2: Akshay is an M.Tech (Communication and Networks) student in the ECE department at IISc. His research interests include design and analysis of next generation wireless systems. He is currently working on developing and implementing a 3GPP aligned Type II CSI, which is a reduced feedback scheme for 5G-NR MIMO systems. This scheme ensures that the overhead of feeding back the channel state information (CSI) does not overwhelm the limited-bandwidth uplink feedback channel.
