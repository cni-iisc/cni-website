description: 
description2: Prasanna received his B.E. degree in Computer Engineering from L. D. College of Engineering, Ahmedabad in 2014. He is currently working under Prof. M Narasimha Murty. He is broadly interested in hypergraphs which are higher-order graphs. His current research focuses on addressing issues involved in hyperedge prediction over hypergraphs. The aim is to develop a machine learning algorithm for hyperedge prediction which is general enough so that it can be applied to hypergraphs emerging in different domains such as biological networks, social networks and communication networks.
