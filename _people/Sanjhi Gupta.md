description: 
description2: Sanjhi is an M.Tech (Communication and Networks) student in ECE department. Her research work is aimed to establish an experimental prototype and evaluate the possible performance enhancement of cell-free distributed MIMO system using the OpenAirInterface built-in emulation platform which provides open source implementations of 5G-NR protocol stack meeting the 3GPP specifications. The system can be used to mitigate the cell-edge effects caused by path-loss and inter-cell interference by allowing the user-equipment to connect to multiple base-stations irrespective of the cell boundary, all of which serves the user in a coordinated manner. Hence, the system provides uniformly good service for all users in addition to greater reliability and large energy efficiency.
