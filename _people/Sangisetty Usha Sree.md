description: 
description2: Usha Sree is a second year M.Tech (Communication and Networks) student in ECE department. She obtained her B.Tech degree in ECE from NIT Warangal in 2019. She is currently working on designing and implementing a multi-hop network for IoT/CPS such that the overall network is simple, consumes less energy and takes less delay in transferring the sensed data from mobile sensors to the fusion centre via an IEEE 802.15.4 infrastructure network. Here, the mobile sensors are clock synchronized to have a common sampling point and the mean batch delay is computed for different sampling rates and network loads in the infrastructure network. The aim is to control the mobile and the infrastructure network for improving the end-to-end inference performance.
