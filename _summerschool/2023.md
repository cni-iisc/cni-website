<div style="text-align:justify">  
  During the course of this 5 days in-person summer school, we will study mathematical tools to solve the dynamic resource allocation problems in communication networks. Most of the resource allocation problems are known to be NP-hard to solve. However, it is possible to design efficient heuristics using the theory of Markov decision processes. We will talk about different heuristics, such as LP-based and Whittle index policies, and provide proof of their performances. To complete these first formal approaches, we will also take a different path to solve such problems by using Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms. 

  All the techniques seen during this class will be illustrated on different network problems such as adaptive routing, TCP control, optimal control of the age of information, and optimal channel selection. This course will also have some lab sessions and we will provide code in python to implement the different algorithms seen during the class.

**FAQ's**

* **Is the summer school being conducted in online mode?** 
  * No, the summer school will not be conducted in online mode. It will be an in-person event to be held at the ECE department, IISc. 

* **Is there a registration fee for the summer school?**
  * No, there is no registration fee for the summer school. 

* **Will accommodation be provided on the IISc campus to the participants?** 
  * The participants can express their willingness for accommodation on the IISc campus in the registration form. However, it is subject to availability, and the corresponding information will be sent to the participants in due course of time. Also, note that the accommodation (if provided) will be on a chargeable basis. 

* **Do I need to bring my laptop for the summer school?** 
  * Yes, you need to bring a laptop to attend the lab sessions in the Python language. 

* **Do I need to pre-install some software for the lab sessions?**
  * No, you do not need to pre-install any software for the lab sessions. We will provide access to the online code execution environment. 

* **Will course participation certificates be provided to the participants?**
  * Yes, course participation certificates be provided. Please try to attend all the sessions of the summer school. 

* **Do I need to pre-install some software for the lab sessions?**
  * No, you do not need to pre-install any software for the lab sessions. You are requested to have a google account so that you can  use Google Colab as the online code execution environment.

* **Will any TA/DA be provided?**
  * No, TA/DA will not be provided to the participants. 

* **Can I use other device (e.g., tablet) to run the codes online?**
  * Yes, you can use other device as well to run the codes as long as you are comfortable with it. 

* **Where can I have my meals during the summer school?**
  * According to the institute norms, the on-campus student dining mess does not allow outsiders to avail the corresponding facility. However, there are a few restaurants present on the campus where the participants can have their meals. 

* **What are the pre-requisites for the summer school?** 
  * The following pre-requisites could be helpful for the participants: 
    1. Convex optimization - LP programming, Duality theory 
    2.  Markov chain - Markov Decision Process 
    3.  Coding - Python 
  * It would be even better if the participants have an understanding of the following: 
    1. Advanced probabilities 
    2. Reinforcement learning
