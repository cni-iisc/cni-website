        Alexandre Reiffers is an assistant professor at IMT Atlantique (Brest). He was previously a post-doctoral fellow at Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber Physical Systems. He received the B.Sc. degree in mathematics (2010) from the university of Marseille, the master degree in applied mathematics (2012) from the university of Pierre et Marie CURIE and the Ph.D. degree in computer science (January 2016) from the INRIA (National research institute in computer science and control) and the university of Avignon. His supervisors were Eitan Altman and Yezekael Hayel. From July 2016 to December 2017, Alexandre Reiffers was a researcher at SafranTech where he was working on comparison of maintenance strategies. 
        Most of his research projects concern the application of mathematical tools (game theory, optimization, stochastic process and machine learning) for a better understanding of real-world problems. The different issues that he studies touch topics such as networks, economy and manufacturing.

<div style="text-align:justify">  
  During the course of this 5 days in-person summer school, we will study mathematical tools to solve the dynamic resource allocation problems in communication networks. Most of the resource allocation problems are known to be NP-hard to solve. However, it is possible to design efficient heuristics using the theory of Markov decision processes. We will talk about different heuristics, such as LP-based and Whittle index policies, and provide proof of their performances. To complete these first formal approaches, we will also take a different path to solve such problems by using Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms. 

  All the techniques seen during this class will be illustrated on different network problems such as adaptive routing, TCP control, optimal control of the age of information, and optimal channel selection. This course will also have some lab sessions and we will provide code in python to implement the different algorithms seen during the class.
