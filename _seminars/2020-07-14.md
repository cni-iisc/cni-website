speaker_bio: "Himanshu Tyagi is an Assistant Professor at the Electrical Communication Engineering department at the Indian Institute of Science. He is a co-convenor of the Centre for Networked Intelligence. He received the Bachelor of Technology degree in electrical engineering and the Master of Technology degree in communication and information technology, both from IIT Delhi in 2007. He received the Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park. From 2013 to 2014, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the Information Theory and Applications (ITA) Center, UCSD."
Topic_abstract: "Emerging applications of cellular communication such as control over wireless links require low latency communication. LTE provides an approximately 15ms latency link, which is supposed to suffice for roughly 150-350ms end-to-end latency requirements. The emerging 5G standard will push this envelop further to even lower latency. But standards just pose a challenge which the technology strives to address. In this talk, we will see what are the typical latency requirements for various applications, what are the main factors that add up to LTE latency, and how 5G is trying to circumvent these bottlenecks of latency. It is a summary of our learnings over the past year as a part of the 5G project where we have been trying to understand the standards, study the limitations of typical implementations, and identify the main bottlenecks for low latency communication in practice. This talk is based on weekly discussions with SVR Anand, Aditya Gopalan, Parimal Parag, and other brave soldiers of the 5G V2X team at the ECE department."
