speaker_bio: "Viswanathan Ramachandran obtained his bachelors and  masters degrees in Electronics and Telecom Engineering from the University of Mumbai in 2011 and 2014 respectively. He recently completed his PhD in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. His research interests are in information theory and wireless communications, particularly in joint source-channel coding and channel simulation problems in multi-terminal settings."

Topic_abstract: "Joint communication and signal estimation is important in several communication systems employing hybrid analog-digital radios. The goal here is to reconstruct an analog signal with reasonable fidelity, while simultaneously conveying a digital data stream. Several interesting multi-user information theoretic models with message and state communication are considered in this talk, for which optimal communication and distortion trade-offs are investigated. We further explore multi-terminal coordination problems, where the objective is to simulate joint probability distributions across distributed terminals, using rate limited links."
