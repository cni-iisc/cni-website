speaker_bio: "Samaresh Bera has submitted his Ph.D. thesis at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kharagpur, India. Currently, he is working as a Visiting Researcher at BTIRC, IISc Bangalore. Prior to joining BTIRC, he worked as a Research Engineer at INRIA Sophia Antipolis, France in a joint collaboration with Nokia Bell Labs, France. He received the M.S. degree from the School of Information Technology, IIT Kharagpur, India in 2015. He has co-authored more than 25 research papers and his publications have received more than 1000 citations in Google Scholar. He was awarded the IEEE Richard E Merwin student scholarship by the IEEE Computer Society in 2017 for his outstanding contributions to the IEEE. Further, he was also selected as ‘Young Researcher’ for attending Heidelberg Laureate Forum, Germany in 2017. His research interests include software-defined networks, 5G networks, and IoT."

Topic_abstract: "The software-defined networking (SDN) technology enables real-time programmability of network devices by decoupling control- and data-planes. Thus, the complexity involved in managing networks is reduced significantly compared to that of the traditional networks. Although different SDN-based approaches exist in the literature, they either focus on the traditional networking issues or are at their infancy to be integrated into fully programmable networks to provide differentiated service provisioning for IoT applications. In this talk, adaptive rule-placement and routing strategies to satisfy heterogeneous quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of traffic from sensors and network devices in SDN-enabled end-to-end IoT networks will be discussed. Further, the scalability issues with a single SDN controller in the presence of a large number of flows in the network will be discussed, and a dynamic controller assignment scheme will be presented to mitigate the scalability issues.
