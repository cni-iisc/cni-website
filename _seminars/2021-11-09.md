speaker_bio: "Dr. Harshan Jagadeesh is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. Prior to joining IIT Delhi, he worked as a Researcher in the Cyber Security group at Advanced Digital Sciences Center, Singapore. Before that he worked as a Research Fellow in the Division of Mathematical Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore and in the Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering at Monash University, Australia. He obtained the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, India. His research interests are in the broad areas of security, wireless networks, and applications of information theory and coding theory to communication and storage."

Topic_abstract:  "Provenance embedding strategies are well known for tracking the footprint of information flow in wireless networks. Such strategies are particularly applicable in untrusted environments wherein we may want to remotely learn the origin of the data, the processes that modified the data and various nodes that have forwarded the data, and so on. In the recent past, low-latency provenance embedding algorithms have received traction in the field of vehicular networks, wherein the participating entities must embed their signatures on the packet with minimum delay owing to strict deadlines on the delivery of packets. In the first part of the talk, we will introduce several use-cases that motivate the need for designing new provenance embedding algorithms in wireless networks. Subsequently, we will present several Bloom-filter based provenance embedding algorithms and study their fundamental limits in learning "
