Topic_abstract: "Modern datacentres often handle computing jobs that are highly parallelisable. Such jobscan be processed at multiple servers in parallel. Although parallel processingreduces the latency of jobs, it comes at the cost of increased communicationoverhead between the servers. Therefore, a natural question in this context is whetherit is possible to achieve significant latency reduction with only a small degreeof parallelism, i.e., a small number of parallel servers per job. Motivatedby this key question, we consider a model in which each job can be servedsimultaneously by multiple distinct processorsharing (PS) servers. The job is considered complete when the total amount ofwork done on it by all the servers equals its size. We analyse the system assumingthat the jobs arrive according to a Poisson process with a rate proportional tothe total number of servers and that each job brings exponentially distributedamount of work with unit mean. We show by a mean-field analysis that in thelarge system limit an exponential reduction in the mean response time isobtained in the heavy traffic limit even with a small degree of parallelism. Wemake significant progress towards rigorously justifying the mean-fieldanalysis."
