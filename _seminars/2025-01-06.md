Topic_abstract: "Data-driven techniques help boost agricultural productivity by increasing yields, reducing losses and cutting down input costs. However, these techniques have seen sparse adoption owing to high costs of manual data collection and limited connectivity solutions. In this talk we will describe our innovations that leverage Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, and Edge Compute in the Farm and Space, to help make affordable digital agriculture solutions. We will also present our product based on this research, which is in preview, and can be used by partners to build their digital agriculture solutions, and how Generative AI can help transform digital agriculture."
