speaker_bio: “Lakshmi Narasimhan is an assistant professor at IIT Madras, and previously at IIT Palakkad. He obtained his PhD from IISc in 2016. He was a postdoctoral fellow at Syracuse University and Fulbright scholar at MIT. His research areas include statistical signal processing and physical layer design for high-dimensional wireless communications.” 

Topic_abstract: “In this talk, we will consider multiple access channels (MAC) with generalized gaussian noise, and peak and average transmit power constraints. For this system, we shall discuss asymptotically optimal and finite-user optimal power allocation strategies that maximize the sum-rate. It will be shown that the greedy power allocation policy can be optimal even for the finite-user scenario. Finally, we shall look at optical wireless MACs that have additional transmit signal constraints and discuss optimal power allocation strategies for those channels.”
