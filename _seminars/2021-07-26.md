speaker_bio: "Ekant Sharma received his M.Tech. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Signal Processing, Communication and Networks Group, Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, India, in May 2011 and May 2020, respectively. From 2011 to 2012, he was with the IBM-Indian Software Lab and worked as an Associate Software Engineer. From August 2019 to January 2021, he worked at 5G Testbed Lab, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur where he designed base station hardware and software algorithms for 5G NR. He is currently working as an Assistant Professor at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee. His Ph.D. thesis received an outstanding thesis award and it was also chosen for the category: SPCOM Best Doctoral Dissertationâ€”Honourable Mention at IEEE SPCOM conference. His research interests are within the areas of wireless communications systems, with a special focus on 5G and beyond wireless systems, energy efficiency, and optimization."


Topic_abstract: "The main focus of this talk will be the design of optimization algorithms for next-generation wireless communication systems, that can provide multi-gigabit data rates and can improve energy consumption and spectrum utilization by orders of magnitude. Several key technologies have emerged in the recent past to make this vision feasible, including full-duplex cooperative wireless communication methods, intelligent reflecting surfaces, cell-free (cloud radio) networks, and non-orthogonal multiple access technologies, among others. Billions of subscribers around the world depend on their mobile phones for their professional and private lives. This, however, comes at the cost of increasing energy consumption. EE metric, which relies on the Pareto-optimality between throughput and energy consumption, has recently drawn attention as a useful performance measure. Motivated by the need to save energy, we will discuss about some energy"
