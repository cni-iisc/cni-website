Topic_abstract: "Fault detection in modern networks     is done with a set of specially instrumented nodes which send probes to     find health of other nodes. These probes generate additional traffic in the     network and compete with other regular traffic for bandwidth. In this talk,     we will discuss a problem of dynamically changing the probes based on     traffic dynamics experienced by nodes. To change the probes dynamically,     we use the traffic profiles generated with I/O statistics.  The idea is to generate a weighted graph of     the network using these traffic profiles and subsequently select a set of     probes such that every node is probed by at least one probe and the selected     probes pass through less congested nodes. Unfortunately, this turns out to     be a NP complete problem. We will discuss few greedy algorithms to select     probes from these weighted graphs of the network. We will also briefly     discuss the simulation experiments and evaluation done with large scale     graphs taken from the ISP networks."
