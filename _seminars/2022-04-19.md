Topic_abstract: "This talk presents the current status of 5G network slicing and its capability levels in end-to-end slicing. These levels span RAN, transport and core networks while considering the challenges of configuration, operations and security. The remainder of the talk then describes the significance of network slicing levels for vertical industries, followed by its applicability to rural and remote connectivity. The talk concludes with selected potential business models to justify the deployment of network slicing both in the urban and rural scenarios."
