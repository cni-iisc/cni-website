speaker_bio: "Sarvendranath Rimalapudi is currently working as an Assistant Professor with the EEE Department of the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati. He received the Bachelor of Technology degree in electrical and electronics engineering from the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal, in 2009, and the Master of Engineering and Ph.D. degrees from the Department of Electrical Communication Engineering (ECE), Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, India, in 2012 and 2020, respectively. From 2009 to 2010, he was a Research Assistant with the Department of Instrumentation, IISc, where he was involved in the development of image processing algorithms. From 2012 to 2016, he was with Broadcom Communications Technologies Pvt. Ltd., Bengaluru, where he worked on the development and implementation of algorithms for LTE and IEEE 802.11ac wireless standards. In 2021, he was a Post-Doctoral Researcher with the Department of Electrical Engineering (ISY), Link√∂ping University, Sweden. His research interests include wireless communications, multiple antenna techniques, spectrum sharing, and next-generation wireless standards.  "
Topic_abstract: "Intelligent reflecting surface, which uses passive reflective elements instead of active radio frequency (RF) chains to reduce cost and energy consumption, is being envisioned as a key enabler for the next generation wireless communication. Transmit antenna selection (AS) is a multiple antenna technology that reduces the number of RF chains at the transmitter while harnessing the benefits of multiple antennas. This talk will focus on addressing the main challenge of the number of pilot transmissions required to combine the benefits of AS and intelligent reflecting surfaces.  For single AS, I will derive the optimal AS rule and propose another simpler AS rule that significantly reduces the number of pilot transmissions. For subset AS, I will discuss a manifold optimization based optimal selection algorithm and an alternating optimization based iterative algorithm, which reduces the subset search complexity. The performance comparison towards the end shows the near-optimal nature of the proposed low-complexity selection algorithms."
