Topic_abstract:"Ad placement in web-browsing and wireless mobiles is an increasingly important component of the advertisement market. The market size is over  100 billion dollar and counting. The mechanism is as follows; when a user opens a webpage or mobile ap a message is sent to an exchange where multiple bidders have the possibility of placing an ad that would target the right user, e.g. age, sex, location, etc. The ad that is displayed corresponds to the bidder whobids the highest while the cost is calculated according to a first or second price. Typically bidders are DSP (Demand Side Platforms) that aggregate bids on behalf of clients who wish to run a campaign for a given length of time with certain targeting criteria. The goal is to minimize the total cost of obtaining the required number of impressions (ads that meet targeting criteria) over the duration of a contract. The real time constraint is that bidding must be done within 100ms. In this talk I will present the theory developed for computing the least cost bids in the second price or Vickrey auction context. This involves the notion of an information state for the problem. There is a very rich primal-dual theory that emerges, one in the so called impressions space and the other in the contracts space. Computationally and structurally the primal and dual views of the optimization have different properties that can be exploited to come up with fast algorithms. The optimal solutions depend on solving a constrained convex optimization problem when the information state is known. However this is not readily available and thus there is the problem of learning the information state. We show that in the second price case, stochastic approximation (SA) algorithms that operate on censored data (prices are only known by a bidder when the bidder wins) can be devised that solve the constrained optimization problem without learning the information state explicitly and we prove their convergence. Finally I will present the dynamic behaviour through simulations. Joint work with Ryan Kinnear (OpenAI), Amirhossein Boreiri (waterloo) and Peter Marbach (Toronto). We thank Addictive Mobility Inc., a Pelmorex company for having proposed the problem and to Addictive Mobility, Ontario OCE VIP II, and NSERC funding the work."
