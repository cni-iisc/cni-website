Topic_abstract:  "We study communication with consensus over the broadcast channel - the receivers reliably decode the senderâ€™s message when the sender is honest, and their decoder outputs agree even if the sender acts maliciously. We characterize the broadcast channels which permit this byzantine consensus and determine their capacity.
Based on joint work with Neha Sangwan and Varun Narayanan. https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06073"
