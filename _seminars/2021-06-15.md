Topic_abstract: "Netneutrality had captured the imagination of policy experts and activists andhence regulators. Two common non neutral behaviour by ISPs are paid priorityand zero-rating;  both of which have some form of regulatory disapprovalin most countries. We will first analyze the effect of such non neutralbehaviour on the content provider side. We then explore some other mechanisms,not explicitly covered by regulation, by which ISPs can, and do, provideeffectively non neutral service to content providers. We will also analyzethese services using some simple models."
