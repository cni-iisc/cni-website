speaker_bio:  "Parthajit Mohapatra obtained his Ph. D. degree in Electrical Communication Engineering from Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India, in 2015. He was working as a postdoctoral research fellow at iTrust center for research in cyber security at Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), Singapore, from March 2015 - July 2016. He was working as an assistant professor at G. S. Sanyal School of Telecommunications at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India, from August 2016 - July 2018. He was also a visiting faculty at Information and Communication Engineering (ICE) Department, Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Technology and Design (DGIST), South Korea during June-July 2017. Since July 2018, he is working as an Assistant Professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Tirupati. His research interests are primarily in the area of physical layer secrecy, short packet communication, union of physical and network layer techniques."
Topic_abstract: "Short packet communication is considered to be a key enabler in supporting two important application scenarios of 5G, namely: (a) massive machine type communication (MTC) and (b) ultra-reliable low-latency communication (uRLLC). With the emergence of new use case scenarios, there is a need to develop a theory for short packet communication which takes account of reliability as well as latency. Information theory has provided models to capture the uncertainty associated with the underlying channel such as noise, fading, and interference. In general, these works do not capture random arrival of data at the users. On the other hand, network theory provides mathematical tools or models to capture the random arrival of data and latency aspects of communication. However, it does not capture the underlying physical channel. The unification of these two theories can provide a more accurate model where it is required to consider the aforementioned aspects jointly. This talk will primarily focus on some of our initial results in these directions with and without secrecy constraints"
