speaker_bio: "Manjesh Kumar Hanawal received a BTech degree in ECE
from NIT, Bhopal, in 2004, an M.S. degree in ECE from the Indian
Institute of Science, Bangalore, India, in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree
from INRIA, Sophia Antipolis and University of Avignon, France, in
2013. After two years of postdoc at Boston University, he joined
Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at the Indian Institute
of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India, where he is an associate
professor now. During 2004-2007  he was with CAIR, DRDO, working on
various security-related projects. His research interests include
communication networks, machine learning, and cybersecurity. He is a
recipient of Inspire Faculty Award from DST and the Early Career
Research Award from SERB. He has received several research grants like
MATRICS from SERB and Indo-French Collaborative Scientific Research
Programme from CEFIPRA. His work received the best paper award
(honorable mention) at COMSNETS 2018."

Topic_abstract: "Millimeter Millimeter Wave (mmWave) communication and
Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS) are promising technologies to
improve throughput in 5G and beyond 5G networks. However, any
misalignment between the Transmitter (Tx) and the Receiver (Rx) beams
significantly reduces their throughput. Hence one needs to learn the
beam directions that offer good throughput between Tx and Rx. We
propose algorithms to learn the beams that offer the best throughput
using the Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) framework. In wireless networks,
scheduling protocol design and implementation can be simpler if the
channel estimation is completed in a fixed duration before the data
transmission can start. Thus, we focus on the Fixed-Budget Best Arm
Identification (FB-BAI) MAB setup to identify the best beam. As it is
desirable to use fewer pilots for learning, we exploit the unimodal
structure of the throughput (as a function beam index) to improve the
error performance of the FB-BAI algorithms. We develop an algorithm
named 'Unimodal Bandit for Best Beam (UB3)' and establish its superior
performance analytically and experimentally compared to the
state-of-the-art.
