speaker_bio: “Classical network scheduling problems have primarily focused on optimizing metrics such as delay, which pertain to the service provided to individual packets in the network. However, in modern applications like tele-robotics and networked cars, the emphasis is on metrics that capture the freshness of information, specifically, how up to date the information is at the receiver (monitor) compared to the transmitter (source). Thus, several metrics have been introduced to quantify information freshness, the most widely used one being the age-of-information (AoI). The AoI for a source at any given time is equal to the difference between the current time and the generation time of the most recent packet (update) received at the monitor.  For modern applications, the scheduling objective is to minimize the AoI for the sources in an online environment, where at any time, only causal information is available. In this talk, I will introduce the AoI metric, and its distinguishing features and scheduling challenges compared to the classical packet-based metrics. Subsequently, I will present some of our recent results on AoI scheduling with multiple sources and energy constraints.” 

Topic_abstract: “In this talk, we will consider multiple access channels (MAC) with generalized gaussian noise, and peak and average transmit power constraints. For this system, we shall discuss asymptotically optimal and finite-user optimal power allocation strategies that maximize the sum-rate. It will be shown that the greedy power allocation policy can be optimal even for the finite-user scenario. Finally, we shall look at optical wireless MACs that have additional transmit signal constraints and discuss optimal power allocation strategies for those channels.”
