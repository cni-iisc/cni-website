speaker_bio: "Madhav Marathe is a Distinguished Professor in Biocomplexity, the division director of the Network Systems Science and Advanced Computing Division at the Biocomplexity Institute  and Initiative, and a Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Virginia.   His research interests are in sustainability science, network science, computational epidemiology, AI, foundations of computing and high performance computing. During his 30 year professional career, he has established and led a number of transdisciplinary groups.  Recently, his group has supported federal and state authorities in their effort  to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Before joining UVA, he held positions at Virginia Tech and  the Los Alamos National Laboratory. He is a Fellow of the IEEE, ACM, SIAM and AAAS. "
Topic_abstract: "Graphical Dynamical systems (GDS) are a special type of communicating automata that can be used to model very large socio-technical systems. GDS based 'formal simulations' potentially provide a rigorous, useful new setting for a theory of interaction-based computation.  The setting is natural for comprehension of distributed systems characterized by interdependent, but separately functioning sub-parts. Massively parallel and grid computing and the associated algorithm design issues, advanced communication systems, biological networks, epidemiological processes, markets, socio-technical systems are examples of such systems. The talk will describe a computational theory of GDS. The concepts and results shed light on the computational complexity of computing phase space properties of GDS.  Applicability of the theory to analyze large scale socio-technical systems will be described."
