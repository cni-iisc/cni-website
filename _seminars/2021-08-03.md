speaker_bio: "Pradeep Kiran Sarvepalli is an Associate Professor at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras. He graduated with a PhD in Computer Science from Texas A & M University in 2008. He also holds a Masterâ€™s degree in Electrical Engineering from Texas A&M University and a B.Tech. degree in Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Madras. He held Post-doctoral Fellowships in the University of British Columbia and Georgia Institute of Technology. He also worked as an IC Design Engineer in Texas Instruments India, Bangalore. His research interests are quantum and classical error correcting codes, quantum cryptography, quantum computation, and coding for distributed storage. "


Topic_abstract: "Coded caching is a technique where we utilize multi-casting opportunities to reduce rate in cached networks. One limitation of coded caching schemes is that they reveal the demands of all users to their peers. In this talk, we consider coded caching schemes that assure privacy for user demands. We focus on reducing sub-packetization in such schemes. For the 2-user, 2-file case, we propose a new linear demand-private scheme with the lowest possible sub packetization. This is done by presenting the scheme explicitly and proving impossibility results under lower sub packetization. We then propose new construction schemes for placement delivery arrays. This includes direct as well as lifting constructions. Coded caching schemes based on these can achieve lower sub packetization. We will also present generalizations of demand private coded caching to various settings.  A new notion of privacy with security is introduced which combines demand privacy and content security; schemes to achieve the same are proposed. Additionally, when only partial privacy is required, we show that sub packetization can be significantly reduced when there are a large number of files. This is joint work with Aravind V R and Andrew Thangaraj. "
