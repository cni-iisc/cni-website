speaker_bio: "Ashok Krishnan K.S. recently completed his Ph.D. from the Department of ECE, IISc. His research interests are in the areas of wireless networks, communications and queueing."
Topic_abstract: "Age of Information (AoI) of packets in a network give a sense of the ‘freshness’ of the information. Applications often require packets to be delivered before they age too much. The talk will discuss a scheduling algorithm designed to transmit packets across the network while meeting age requirements of multiple flows, simultaneously. The algorithm uses a packet dropping rule and a slot wise optimization, which can also be implemented in a distributed fashion. It is seen to perform well, and brings the age close to a theoretical lower bound."
