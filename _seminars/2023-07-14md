Topic_abstract: "We prove a Sanov-type large deviation principle for the component empirical measures of certain sequences of unimodular random graphs (including Erdos-Renyi and random regular graphs) whose vertices are marked with i.i.d. random variables. Specifically, we show that the rate function can be expressed in a fairly tractable form involving suitable relative entropy functionals. As a corollary, we establish a variational formula for the annealed pressure (or limiting log partition function) for various statistical physics models on sparse random graphs.
Joint work with I-Hsun Chen and Kavita Ramanan.
