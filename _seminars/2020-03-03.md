speaker_bio: "Prof. Rajesh Sundaresan received the B.Tech. degree in electronics and communication from IIT Madras, India, and the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA, in 1996 and 1999, respectively. From 1999 to 2005, he worked with Qualcomm Inc., where he was involved in the design of communication algorithms for wireless modems. Since 2005, he has been with the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India, where he is currently a Professor with the Department of Electrical Communication Engineering and an Associate Faculty with the Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber-Physical Systems. His interests include the areas of communication, computation, and control over networks."

Topic_abstract: "The talk will be on the mean-field limit of an interacting particle system, for e.g., a WiFi system. The fixed-point analysis is a useful technique that helps the analyst understand the systemâ€™s equilibrium behaviour. One can identify four levels of fixed points that fix (1) the relationship between certain macroscopic observables of the system, (2) the equilibrium distribution over particle states, (3) the evolution of the mean-field over time, and (4) the law associated with the limiting Markovian evolution of a particle. The talk will highlight these four levels and how they are related to each other."
