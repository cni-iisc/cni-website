Topic_abstract: "Serverless (also known as Function-as-a-Service) has emerged as the next dominant cloud architecture. In serverless, developers structure their cloud application as a collection of stateless functions that execute on-demand. Despite accepted benefits to both developers and cloud providers, the serverless model brings new challenges calling for cross-layer characterization and optimization. Alas, today's state-of-the-art serverless stacks are propriety to each individual cloud provider, which impedes research in this space. In this talk, I will overview the serverless model and introduce the vHive open-source ecosystem developed at the Edinburgh Architecture and Systems (EASE) Lab. vHive includes a complete serverless stack, a suite of serverless workloads and robust tools for performance analysis and debug, which together enable meaningful serverless research at any scale. I will describe two vHive-enabled projects targeting performance analysis and optimization across the system stack that underscore both challenges and opportunities in today's serverless deployments."
