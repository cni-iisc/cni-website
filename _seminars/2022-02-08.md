speaker_bio:  "Satyajit Thakor joined the School of Computing and Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Mandi in January 2014, where he is currently an Associate Professor. Prior to that, he was a research assistant and postdoctoral fellow at the Institute of Network Coding, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, from October 2011 to January 2014. He received the B.Eng. degree in Electronics and Telecommunication from Dr. B. A. M. University, India, in 2004. He received the M.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees in Telecommunications in 2006 and 2012 from the University of South Australia, respectively. His research interests include information theory, network coding, and algorithms. Dr. Satyajit Thakor is a recipient of the Teaching Honour Roll Award (2021) of IIT Mandi for excellence in teaching, the Michael Miller Medal (2013) of UniSA for his Ph.D. thesis, and the Endeavour Research Fellowship (2009) of the Australian Government towards a research visit to the CUHK."
Topic_abstract: "Network coding outperforms routing in directed acyclic networks. However, for undirected multiple-unicast networks, it was conjectured in 2004 that network coding has no rate benefit over routing. Despite its importance, the conjecture is still unsolved in general, and it is verified for only a handful of network instances and classes of networks. In this talk, we will review this problem and present an information-theoretic upper bound on the undirected multiple-unicast network information flow. We will also discuss results on its tightness and achievability for a class of undirected multiple-unicast networks."
