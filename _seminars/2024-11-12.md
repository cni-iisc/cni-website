speaker_bio: "Mohit P. Tahiliani is an Associate Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at National Institute of Technology Karnataka (NITK), Surathkal, India. He has contributed to open-source projects for more than a decade. A packet scheduler developed by his team at NITK Surathkal to fight the Bufferbloat problem got merged into the mainline of the Linux kernel (v5.6). His team has built an open source network emulator for teaching and research, which has been adopted in several colleges and supported by industries. He is a Member of the Steering Committee of the ns-3 consortium, and a co-maintainer of traffic-control and TCP modules in ns-3. He is serving as a Mentor for Google Summer of Code (GSoC) from 2017 till date for the ns-3 organization and has been one of the Organization Administrators since 2021. He also served as an Organization Administrator for ns-3 in Google Code-In (GCI) during 2018 and 2019. He is a Member of ACM and TiE, and a Senior Member of IEEE."

Topic_abstract: "Bloated buffers in the Internet add significant queuing delays and directly impact the user perceived latency. CoDel (Controlled Delay) and PIE (Proportional Integral controller Enhanced) are popular queue disciplines to tackle the Bufferbloat problem. This talk will cover an overview of CoDel and PIE, their robustness against the unresponsive flows, details of a bug-fix in the Linux implementation of PIE and an overview of FQ-PIE (Flow Queue PIE), a new packet scheduler released in Linux 5.6 by NITK Surathkal."
