Topic_abstract: "Enterprises are deploying applications across an increasingly large number of Public, Private and Edge Clouds. This talk will highlight some of the trends in this space and the challenges it poses on multi-cloud networking and observability across these geo-distributed Cloud environments. Specifically, the talk will explore challenges and approaches in supporting “application-aware” network connectivity across heterogeneous Cloud environments, leveraging Observability and AI-based operational analytics. We will also discuss how insights derived from analytics can assist intelligent automation for managing applications communicating across heterogeneous multi-cloud environments."
