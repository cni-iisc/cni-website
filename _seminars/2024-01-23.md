Topic_abstract: “Software Engineering interviews are very different from the actual Software Engineering work on the job. Clearing interviews is what a lot of experienced people, who are pretty good at their work, also struggle with. To standardize the interview process, top tech companies (also called FAANG companies, acronym for Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix & Google) have standardized their interview process & various other companies have adopted the pattern. In this talk, I would be telling about the pattern & also how to prepare for it. 10 years back, people studied computer science books to prepare but the RoI of the activity has become fairly limited & much more optimized 'algorithms' have come out, which if followed, will lead to a better chance of clearing interviews. He has written about his own experience of preparing for these interviews at https://pocha.substack.com/p/how-to-start-preparing-for-algods .”
