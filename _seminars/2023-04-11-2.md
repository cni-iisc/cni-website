Topic_abstract: " Covid hit the world with unforseen ferocity and speed,
rendering all responses, drugs and existing knowledge around disease
containment invalid. The world was showing signs of mass panic. As India
hurtled into lockdown, the two most urgent needs were to provide
clarity, first response to those in need and to see the disease spread
at a local, regional level at scale. An experimental digital effort
began amalgamating several innovators amid this chaos, went from idea to
launch in a week evolved into what we now know as Aarogya Setu. Aarogya
Setu is remarkable as digital infrastructure, India's scientific
temperament, its commitment to inclusion and at the same time a stark
reminder of human failing and archaic policy infrastructure. With
Aarogya Setu, India was able to see Covid. But, the saddest, undeniable
part is this infrastructure was abandoned when the country needed it
most. But many say it did a lot of good, academics abroad say the scale
and quality of Aarogya Setu is unprecedented in the free world. And its
final contribution was to evolve into a trusted, high fidelity global
standard vaccine response. This talk will take a walk down this memory
lane we wish never happens, but its clear we must prepare for."
