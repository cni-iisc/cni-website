Topic_abstract: "Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems play an integral role in our daily lives, and we are currently witnessing an explosion of the IoT ecosystem, which includes not only smartphones but also smart, ubiquitous objects embedded with communication, computation, and sensing capabilities. Emerging IoT systems, such as autonomous vehicles, immersive virtual and augmented reality, tactile internet, holoportation, and smart, connected buildings, promise to automate human lives at unprecedented levels this decade. However, such systems rely on two critical foundations: (1) Next-generation wireless network architectures that can serve billions of devices; and (2) Ubiquitous sensing techniques that enable the objects to be \"truly smart\" by understanding and interpreting the ambient conditions and micro-activities with high precision.

My research team has been building these two foundations. We design, develop, and deploy experimental data-driven computational and deep learning models to extract intelligence from wireless signals, which, in turn, enable ubiquitous sensing modalities and high-resilience and high-performance networks. In this talk, I will go through some of the design and prototyping of our current works that use extremely high-frequency millimeter-wave wireless to enable wire-like connectivity and reliability, and applications in healthcare and beyond traditional visions."
