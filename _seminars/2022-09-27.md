speaker_bio: "Dr. Pooja Vyavahare is an Assistant Professor at Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian
Institute of Technology Tirupati since 2019. Before joining IIT Tirupati, she was a post-doctoral fellow
with the Coordinated Science Laboratory at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. She obtained
her Ph.D from the Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay. Her research interests include
analysis of communication networks, and network economics."
 
Topic_abstract: "In this talk, we consider a general version of opinion dynamics in discrete-time multiagent
networks when interactions among agents are either cooperative (trust) or antagonistic (mistrust).
In the first half of the presentation, we will discuss the cluster consensus problem and role of structurally
balanced networks in this setting. We will present the sufficient condition on network structure to achieve
cluster consensus and for stability. In the second half of the presentation, we will discuss distributed
learning in networks with trust-mistrust interactions. We will present a distributed algorithm and its
asymptotic analysis for distributed learning in this setting. We will briefly touch upon some of the future
directions of research in this area."
