Topic_abstract: "A perturbed dynamical system is said to exhibit the metastability phenomenon when it behaves very differently over different time scales. Many networked systems such as load balancing networks, WiFi networks, etc. exhibit such phenomenon when there are multiple stable operating points in the system. One approach to quantify the metastability phenomenon is to study large deviations of this perturbed dynamics in the stationary regime. This talk will provide an overview of various techniques (in the existing literature) to obtain large deviations in the stationary regime from process-level large deviations."
