Topic_abstract: "Multimedia services are an integral part of our lives and we use them in various forms (entertainment, educational, or applications) through our devices (laptop, mobile, computer, television, tablets, smart glasses, etc.). New usecases and applications that use multimedia content in some form or the other, arise almost everyday. The wireless networks facilitate the seamless usage of such services by heterogeneous mobile users. Overall, the wireless networks have seen a surge in multimedia traffic and demand for high quality content in recent years. The advances in codecs, streaming architectures, and efficient network resource allocation solutions combinedly contribute towards enhanced multimedia services in mobile networks. This talk will discuss the evolution of Multimedia services and the expected future trends with the advent of next generation wireless networks. A few cross-layer optimization frameworks will also be discussed to analyze possible ways to enhance multimedia services in future wireless networks and  evaluate their overall performance."
