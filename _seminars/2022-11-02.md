Topic_abstract: "Along with the rapid growth and rise to prominence of food delivery platforms, concerns have also risen about the conditions of the \"gig workers\" underpinning this growth. Our analysis on data derived from a real-world food delivery platform across three large cities from India show that there is significant inequality in the money food delivery agents earn. We focus on the problem of ensuring fair income distribution among agents while also maintaining timely food delivery. Unfortunately, the problem is not only NP-hard but also inapproximable in polynomial time. We overcome this computational bottleneck through a novel matching algorithm called FAIRFOODY, achieving upto 10 times improvement in equitable income distribution, albeit with higher cost to the platform. We further propose WORK4FOOD, which provides income guarantees to delivery agents, while minimizing platform costs and ensuring customer satisfaction. To incorporate these objectives, WORK4FOOD balances supply and demand by controlling the number of agents in the system and providing dynamic payment guarantees to agents based on factors such as agent location, ratings, etc. The above two works have appeared in AAAI and IJCAI conferences this year."
