speaker_bio: "M. Nikhil Krishnan received the B.Tech. degree in electronics and communication engineering from the Amrita School of Engineering, Amritapuri Campus, in 2011, and the M.E. degree in telecommunications and the Ph.D. degree in electrical communication engineering from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, in 2013 and 2019, respectively. He was a Postdoctoral Fellow with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, from 2019 to 2021. From 2021 to 2022, he was an Assistant Professor with the International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore. He is currently an Assistant Professor with the Department of Data Science, Indian Institute of Technology Palakkad."

Topic_abstract: "In real-time interactive communication, packet losses can disrupt the timely recovery of message packets at the receiver. Streaming codes are packet-level erasure codes which facilitate delay-constrained recovery of message packets under such a scenario. In this talk, we will consider a three-node setting, where there is a source-relay link and a relay-destination link. In particular, we will discuss the situation where a burst of packets is lost on both the links. By leveraging previously known techniques, we will derive a simple upper bound on the rate of streaming codes for this setting. The focus of this talk will be a streaming code construction that achieves rates arbitrarily close to the rate upper bound. This is a joint work with Vinayak Ramkumar and Myna Vajha."
