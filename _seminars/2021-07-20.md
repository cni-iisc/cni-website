Topic_abstract: "We consider a continuous time multi-arm bandit problem (CTMAB), where the learner can sample arms any number of times in a given interval and obtain a random reward from each sample, however, increasing the frequency of sampling incurs an additive penalty/cost. Thus, there is a trade-off between obtaining large reward and incurring sampling cost as a function of the sampling frequency. The goal is to design a learning algorithm that minimizes the regret, that is defined as the difference of the payoff of the oracle policy and that of the learning algorithm. CTMAB is fundamentally different than the usual multi-arm bandit problem (MAB), e.g., even the single arm case is non-trivial in CTMAB, since the optimal sampling frequency depends on the mean of the arm, which needs to be estimated. We establish lower and upper bounds that are tight up to logarithmic terms.
