Topic_abstract: "Mobile communication has gained lots of interests in recent years as operators across the world try to keep up with the explosive growth in mobile broadband traffic, and to offer innovative new applications and services to continue the momentum of the mobile computing revolution. In this talk, I will provide a brief overview of my research activities related to enabling technologies for 5G and Beyond with a focus on artificial intelligence (AI)-Inspired Wireless Communications. To be specific, I will first discuss top challenges of incorporating AI in wireless communications and introduce the concept of the reservoir computing, a brain-inspired recurrent neural network-based computing methodology, to address some of the key challenges. As a critical task for receive processing, we investigate the application of reservoir computing in the classification task — symbol detection task for MIMO-OFDM systems. Unlike most existing neural network-based symbol detection strategies which require large training sets/overheads, our goal is to design reservoir computing-based symbol detector under limited training sets so that the size of the utilized training set is compatible with those adapted in modern wireless standards (e.g., 3GPP LTE/LTE-Advanced and Wi-Fi). Compared with the benchmark methods (linear minimum mean square error detector and sphere decoder), numerical evaluations suggest that reservoir computing-based MIMO-OFDM symbol detector can improve the symbol detection performance as well as effectively mitigate model mismatch effects using very limited training symbols. Furthermore, we developed a real-time online learning version of the reservoir computing-based MIMO-OFDM symbol detector and implemented the strategy on the software defined radio (SDR) platform for Wi-Fi systems. Keep the Wi-Fi transmitter untouched, the new plug-and-play reservoir computing-based Wi-Fi receiver is comp	
ared with traditional Wi-Fi receivers using over-the-air experiments. The performance suggests that the introduced symbol detector outperforms conventional Wi-Fi symbol detection methods in various environments indicating the significance and the relevance of the work.
