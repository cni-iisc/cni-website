Topic_abstract: "Google owns and operates one of the world's largest networks, supporting billions of users. Today, this network not only supports the users of Google's various applications such as  Search, Youtube, Gmail and Maps, it also forms a critical part of the infrastructure supporting enterprise customers of the Google Cloud Platform. Given the scale and the challenging requirements of such varied applications, the network incorporates many aligned but complementary techniques to ensure high network reliability. In this talk, I will describe some of these techniques, and how they work in tandem to provide a high-reliability network to all of Google's users. "
