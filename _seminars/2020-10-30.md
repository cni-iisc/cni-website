Topic_abstract: "Microgrids are receiving attention due to the increasing need to integrate distributed generations and to ensure power quality and energy surety. At the same time, the great evolution in communication and information technology is leading the transformation of microgrids into smart grids, where the continuous dialogue between all of the devices connected to the network implies improvements in the overall efficiency and quality of the system. This presentation mainly focuses on background and fundamental building blocks of smart grid with stringent emphasis on practical applications in the existing power system network. An overview of smart grid and its potential in different types of power sectors such as power generation, transmission and distribution in Metro, Urban/Semi urban and remote locations of India is described. This also emphasizes on renewable energy source integration in present grids as well as in micro, nano grids and explores its issues in protection, operation, and control. In addition to it, this further provides utility level analysis in terms of energy management, optimal setting, and operation of conventional and renewable based power plants."
