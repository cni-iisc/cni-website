Topic_abstract: "A smart space system consists of sensors, actuators, and computational devices to create an interactive space. Some examples of such smart spaces are homes, offices, and buildings. In this talk, we will discuss a system that creates a smart space using the long-range network in an efficient manner, wherein the efficiency is defined in terms of all-together: energy, security, delay, and cost. The system aims to successfully and securely receive the sensory data at the application server in a given time with minimal energy consumption and cost of the security mechanism. The system uses a deep learning-based compression-decompression model to reduce the size of data at the Edge devices and game theory to find a minimum-cost security mechanism. The system also formulates an optimization problem to obtain a suitable compression ratio and security mechanism to reduce the system's energy consumption, delay, and security cost.
