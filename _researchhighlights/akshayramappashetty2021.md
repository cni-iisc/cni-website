Feedback Reduction using Type II
CSI in 5G NR MIMO Systems
In a cellular system, the uplink channel carries the feedback bits indicating channel
state information (CSI) in order to enable an appropriate modulation and coding scheme
(MCS) along with scheduling data to multiple users in the downlink. This means there is
a trade-o between the feedback information and the data the uplink channel can carry.
Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based fth-generation (5G) cellular
systems use downlink scheduling, adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) and multiinput multi-output (MIMO) to increase spectral eciency. Reduced feedback schemes
are a crucial component of such systems. These schemes ensure that the overhead of
feeding back the CSI does not overwhelm the limited-bandwidth uplink feedback channel.
In this work, rst, we try to understand and develop 3GPP aligned MIMO Type II CSI
feedback scheme as specied in the technical specication of 5G NR. While Type II CSI
generation is specied in the standard, some details related to it, such as how to generate
the wideband and subband-specic components, are left open for interpretation. We
propose to develop methods that address these open gaps and ensure feedback generation
that is as close to perfect CSI as possible. Second, we study QuaDRiGa channel simulator
to generate MIMO channel traces for single-user (SU-MIMO) scenario and corresponding
Type II traces using algorithm developed in the rst step.
My role in the project was to implement the Type II CSI generation algorithm for SUMIMO single and multi-rank transmission by incorporating dual-polarized uniform planar
array (UPA) antennas at the base station. To evaluate the eectiveness of regenerated
dual-stage precoder using Type II CSI, we consider reconstruction error and rate as the
two performance metrics with rate being the key performance indicator (KPI). Cell-wide
simulation results shows that the algorithm could generate the Type II precoder close to
the ideal precoder.

Networking Module Hands-on Laboratory
I had got the opportunity to get involved with CNI and a few other colleagues in developing a networking module based on congestion control, a part of the hands-on laboratory
course. This lab course was designed for the master's students in the ECE department at
IISc. The work was primarily based on creating the content and structuring the module
for the rst-year students.
