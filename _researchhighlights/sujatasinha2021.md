I have been working on designing and simulating Orthogonal Space-Time Frequency (OTFS) 
modulation for Visible Light Communications in an indoor local area network environment. OTFS is 
2D signalling technique which effectively tackles the high mobility issues in time varying wireless 
communications. The setup uses low-cost Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) and Photodetectors (PD) for 
transmitters and receivers instead of hardware used in RF communication. The spectrum used is the 
visible light spectrum (wavelength: 400 - 700 nm) which is available in abundance at no cost, without 
the need for licensing, no radiation issues and provides inherent security in closed room application. 
Also, using white light, it can simultaneously be used for data transmission and lightening.
In the study to analyse the performance of OTFS in indoor VLC setup using multi-LEDs and multi-PDs 
(similar to MIMO in RF), we have proposed 4 block transmission schemes using dual-LEDs and quadLED setup, namely, 1) Non-DC biased OTFS (NDC-OTFS), 2) Dual-LED complex modulation OTFS 
(DCM-OTFS), 3) Quad-LED complex modulation OTFS (QCM-OTFS), and, 4) Spatial modulation dualLED complex modulation OTFS (SM-DCM-OTFS). These schemes have been analysed and compared 
with their respective OFDM schemes present in the literature. We evaluated their bit error 
performance and spatial distribution. All the schemes stated above have shown superior 
performance compared to their OFDM counterparts. The proposed schemes eliminate the use of 
Hermitian symmetry and DC-bias for transmitting real and non-negative signals suitable to be 
transmitted through LEDs and thereby, increasing the rates of transmission. 
This work potentially motivates further research on other possible MIMO VLC architectures using 
OTFS. Also, this research can help implementation of Network Intelligence systems in wireless 
networks and networks for smart cities by increasing their cost efficiency and providing security in 
closed room setup.
