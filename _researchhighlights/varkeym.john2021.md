**Research Conducted**

Title: On Connections between Opacity and Security in Linear Systems
Our research focussed on finding a relation between attack detection and the privacy notion
‘opacity’ in linear systems. We showed that a fundamental trade-off exists between these two 
properties. In particular, if an opaque system is subjected to attacks, all attacks cannot be detected. 
We first characterized the opacity conditions for the system in terms of its weakly unobservable 
subspace (WUS) and showed that the number of opaque states is proportional to the size of the 
WUS. Further, we established conditions under which increasing the opaque sets also increases the 
set of undetectable attacks. This highlighted a fundamental trade-off between security and privacy. 
We demonstrated application of our results on a remotely controlled automotive system.

**Other Work**

The CNI website is currently hosted using WordPress. However, this has issues such as reliability, 
security and maintainability. Therefore, it was proposed to develop the CNI website using a static
site generator instead so as to meet these requirements. 
For this purpose, we developed the entire CNI website from scratch in Jekyll framework. Additional 
custom features were also incorporated into the website. The design and layout of the entire 
website were also improved tremendously.
The new website was hosted on GitHub: https://cni-iisc.github.io/cni-website/index.html
