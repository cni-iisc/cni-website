This was a sponsored project by Power Grid Corporation of India Limited. We developed a vulnerability assessment framework for SAS substations using an NLP-based model and Bayesian networks to identify, map, and compute exploitation probabilities of vulnerabilities based on the CVE database, thereby providing an overall vulnerability landscape for improved security measures.
