Micro-robotics is an emerging field of research where the focus areas are physical actuation, system control, materials, sensor research and so on. It is an interdisciplinary field
where researchers from communities such as physics, chemistry, engineering (biotech, mechanical, comp science) have a role to play. The goal is to contribute to the development
of a small-scale robotic system that can see application in the fields of targeted medicine,
environment monitoring, water body treatment, small scale manufacturing, and so on.
A micro-robot is a controllable machine of micron scale with application specific capabilities in addition to generic functions such as motion, sensing and control mechanism. Scaling
robotic systems to micro-scale forces us to focus on physical parameters such as surface tension, adhesion and drag instead of mass and inertia. The actuation machines must now be
similar to cilia, pseudopodia, flagella as observed in the nature. There has been research in
development of actuation mechanisms at micron scale such as magnetically actuated rigid
helices, cilia and sperm-mimetic synthetic tails, chemically powered spherical particles and
cannons, synthetically engineered bacteria, muscle cells, etc.[2]
Parallel research in this field studies the swarm behaviour and control of such microrobots. There are experimental studies of behaviour of different shaped para-magnetic particles under the influence of rotating 3D magnetic field in literature.[3, 4] There is also a
study on active matter that is independent of the influence of external control.[1]
In our work, we are studying the effect of external control on active particle behaviour. In
this direction, we have done a few simulations to model the efficiency of a swarm in reaching
a defined target region. We have studied the swarm behaviour with and without controlling
the mean location of the swarm with the help of external control like magnetic field. We
designed a hardware setup to study the effect of external control on active particles. The
setup uses a speaker to emulate Brownian motion of small spherical particles on a flat plate.
The effect of magnetic field has been emulated by tilting the plane of the base-plate so as to
move the swarm of vibrating particles towards a target region.
In our future work, we plan to explore the effect of change in the design of each particle
to study its effect on the entire swarm and also explore the changes of control parameters
over the same.
