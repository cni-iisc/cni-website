**1 Research Work**
- Remotely Operated Underwater Vehicle 
    
    The main objective of this project is to develop a low-cost, custom-tethered ROV that can carry 10 Kg 
    as a payload for tele autonomous deployment in water bodies. For my part of the work, I am focusing 
    on the design of the chassis frame and different types of Thrusters and Propellers, which will increase 
    the total payload capacity of the ROV.
