    - With the increasing demand for Power across the globe, Power System network has seen a tremendous growth in terms of the infrastructure. The backbone of the control technology lies in the communication networks so that the devices in the power system network can exchange data, analyse, and take intelligent decisions. The communication and physical layer together constitute a Cyber-Physical system. Research work carried out focuses on building such a CyberPhysical network in the context of Power Engineering domain. The representation is carried out using technical standards defined and outputs a graph-based representation of the CyberPhysical network Such a mapping will help in assessing the system from the aspect of Vulnerability assessment. An abstract of the work has been accepted at the Power System Computation Conference and the full-paper is yet to be submitted on the same.
