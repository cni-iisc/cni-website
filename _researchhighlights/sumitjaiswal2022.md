**1 Research Work**
Fifth-generation (5G) cellular systems are increasingly embracing millimetre wave (mmWave) 
communication, where abundant bandwidth in the range of 20-300 GHz is available to achieve data 
rates in Gbps. One of the main challenges in using mmWave systems is the high propagation loss at 
these frequency bands, on account of which the effective communication range of the mmWave base 
station remains around 100 metres. Hence, there are many relays required for reliable 
communication. Thus, the deployment density of base stations in 5G becomes very high, leading to 
high infrastructure costs for the operators. The network deployment engineers often do the 
deployment based on field visits, surveys, measurements, and initial deployments, followed by finetuning. For the scalability of such deployments, automated network planning tools are essential. Such 
tools should be able to predict the coverage based on the given geographical information system (GIS) 
data, identify the need for relays and, if needed,suggest the number and locations of relays to provide 
reliable connectivity for the full-duplex systems. The focus of the current project is to come up with 
good criteria for the optimization of the number and locations of these relays. Further, we seek to 
develop a good algorithm to maximize the flows through the full-duplex 5G cellular network, thereby 
increasing the network capacity.
