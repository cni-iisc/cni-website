**Research Summary**

In this research, our goal is to understand the large time behaviour and metastability in networked
systems such as WiFi networks, cloud computing systems, societal networks with rational agents, etc.
We consider a mean-field interacting particle system with N particles. Each particle has a state associated
with it which evolves in a Markovian fashion where the rates of transition depend on the other particles
only through the empirical measure of the states of all the particles. Such a particle system is useful in
modelling many networked systems. It turns out that the performance of these systems can be understood
from the stationary behaviour of the empirical measure process, and our research focuses on studying
the same. We are particularly interested in studying metastable phenomena such (i) the mean time for
the system to be close to stationarity, (ii) the mean exit time from an operating point, etc. We can then
use insights from this study to drive better design of such systems. We mainly use the theory of large
deviations as a tool to study such questions. A more detailed break-up of my research during the past
academic year is as follows.

August 2019 – November 2019: We worked on an extension of the above mean-field model where the
system is subject to a fast varying random environment. We established the process level large deviation
principle (LDP) for such a system and used this to study metastability phenomena in such systems. This
work has been written up and it is under review.
November 2019 – March 2020: I visited Netradyne Technologies Pvt. Ltd., where I worked on
the impact of real time feedback on driving behaviour in collaboration with Bengaluru Metropolitan
Transport Corporation (BMTC). I worked under the guidance of Prof. Rajesh Sundaresan, along with
my labmates Nihesh and Karthik. In this work, based on visual data analytics, we proposed an automated
approach to identify violations on the Bus Priority Lane (BPL) on outer ring road. We then studied the
improvement in travel time after the introduction of the BPL. We also studied the impact of real time
feedback (such as alters for tailgating, over speeding etc.) on driving behaviour. Preparation of a final
report of this work is in progress.

March 2020 – July 2020: I worked on the problem of large deviations of the invariant measure in
a mean-field model where each particle’s state comes from a countable set (e.g. a system of interacting
queues). Such a countable state-space model poses some technical challenges in establishing the LDP.
We have made good progress in tacking these technical challenges.
As part of COVID-19 response, I worked on building a city-scale agent-based simulator to study the
impact of various non-pharmaceutical interventions in Indian cities. This work was done with a larger
team of people from IISc and TIFR. We built a state of the art agent-based simulator that captures
the interaction among people at various places, and it is capable of implementing a wide variety of
interventions such as lockdown, testing and contact tracing, etc. We used the simulator to study the
impact of various interventions in Mumbai and Bengaluru. I also worked on (with a larger team from
IISc and ISI Bengaluru) the problem of allocating test samples from swab collection centres to COVID-19
testing labs across Karnataka so as to minimise a certain measure of the collective backlog at labs as
well as the cost of transporting the samples. Our solution was demonstrated to the Bruhat Bengaluru
Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) commissioner.
