The aim of this report is to provide a brief overview of the key highlights such as publications, projects and other
technical reports originating from five years of Cisco-IISc Research Fellowship.

**Publications**

IEEE Access 2020 Coverage Estimation in Outdoor Heterogeneous Propagation Environments,
Volume 8         Nihesh Rathod, Renu Subramanian, Rajesh Sundaresan
WMNC 2019        Relay Placement Algorithms for Communication in a Heterogeneous Propagation

**Projects**

**July, 2020 –Onwards**

Swabs to Labs: A framework designed to aid officials distribute the swab samples to testing
labs efficiently to speed up the report generation time while meeting the lab test capacities,
minimising the distribution/travel time of samples etc.

**March, 2020 –July, 2020**

City-Scale Agent-Based Simulators for the Study of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions in the Context of the COVID-19 Epidemic: An agent-based simulator to study the
impact of various non- pharmaceutical interventions in the context of the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic. Some of the key features of the simulator include age-stratified interaction
that captures heterogeneity in interaction among people in a given interaction space, the
ability to implement various interventions such as soft ward containment, phased opening of
workplaces and community spaces, a broad class of contact tracing based testing and case
isolation protocols, etc.

**May, 2020 – June, 2020**

COVID-19 Epidemic: A Workplace Readiness Indicator: The COVID-19 Readiness
Indicator is an online assessment tool that enables organisations to understand their current
level of preparedness and key risk areas. It also helps in planning and in establishing
pandemic-specific policies, procedures, and necessary management practices.

**November, 2019 – March, 2020**

Study of Driving Patterns Among Public Transport Bus Drivers: A joint project
between BMTC, Netradyne and CiSTUP, IISc to understand the driving patterns of BMTC
drivers and scored them for their safe driving behaviour. The project also aided the assessment
of the Bus Priority Lane implemented on the 30 km stretch of NH 44, between Silk Board
Junction and Indiranagar Bus Depot.

**May, 2016 – December, 2016**

Bheemboy – A course registration website developed for IISc: Coursereg is a webapp
for managing course registrations at academic institutions. Students can register for courses
on the Coursereg website. The registrations can be reviewed by the student’s adviser,
the relevant course instructor, and department admins. After the registration is complete,
students can opt to change the registration type (Credit, Audit, etc.) or drop the course
within the specified date. On completion of the course, instructors can assign grades.
