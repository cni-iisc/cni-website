**Hyperedge Prediction in Hypergraphs**

◦ Hypergraphs are higher-order graphs where a relation (a hyperedge or hyperlink) exists
between a set of entities as opposed to a Graph where a relation (an edge) can exist only
between a pair of entities.
◦ Hyperedge prediction is the task of prediction missing hyperedges or future hyperedges given
the knowledge of existing hyperedges.
Key Contributions
◦ We are first to explore the impact of negative sampling techniques [1] used for the hyperedge
prediction task. In addition, we also propose novel negative sampling techniques which
improve upon techniques widely used in literature.
◦ We further propose a clique-closure hypothesis (CCH) [2] for formation of hyperedges in a
hypergraph. Our proposed C3MM algorithm, which embeds CCH hypothesis, out performs
existing methods on the hyperedge prediction task.
◦ We also establish a sub-higher order (SHO) paradigm for hyperedge evolution and propose
a novel neural network architecture, named SHONeN, which shows that SHO paradigm is
better at predicting future hyperedges than existing 2O and HO paradigms.
