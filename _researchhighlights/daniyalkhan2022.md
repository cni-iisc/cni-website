In networked control systems, estimation of different process parameters/states is extremely 
important so that the controller is up to date with the processes, and hence, can control the system 
as desired, and maintain stability. Such estimation is done using sensors, which are usually placed at 
locations that are different from the controllers. These sensors take measurements, perform some 
local computations, and communicate the processed measurements to the remote controllers either 
through a wired or a wireless channel. For this purpose, there exists a need for a communication 
network protocol designed such that the controller is kept updated without network congestion. It 
would also be beneficial, if the protocol is such that it allows the network to be used for other 
applications and still maintains certain level of performance. Traditional protocols like TCP are not 
suited for applications where simple reliability is not of utmost importance and certain transmission 
requirements must be satisfied. Hence, we tackled this design issue by formulating a Network Utility 
Maximization (NUM) problem with the objective of minimizing estimation error at the controller and 
finding distributed solutions to this optimization problem.
