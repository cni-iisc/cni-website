Connectivity is the backbone of the networked intelligence stack. In particular, wireless 
connectivity using licensed spectrum is critical for network intelligence applications requiring 
mobility and service quality. The latest cellular technology, i.e., the 5G network, provides a 
flexible, scalable, agile, and programmable platform to manage various applications with 
diverse requirements within the same network. However, since the 5G network is built on 
cellular architecture, the user's performance at the cell-edge is limited.
The cell-edge user in traditional cellular network experiences degraded quality of service 
compared to cell-center user due to path loss and interference from neighboring base 
stations. Cell-free is a promising technology that can improve the cell-edge performance as 
it offers macro-diversity and consequently improved coverage and throughput. Moreover, 
the network capacity in a cellular network is often underutilized due to a static TDD
configuration coupled with asymmetric traffic demands in neighboring cells. To handle 
heterogeneous traffic demands, dynamic TDD is considered to be a beneficial technology, 
wherein different cells can independently schedule slots in the uplink/downlink directions 
depending on their local traffic demands. However, dynamic TDD brings new challenges 
because of the introduction of new cross-link interferences (CLI) between users and between 
base stations. Combining cell-free MIMO with dynamic TDD can effectively overcome the 
CLI, as there exists inbuilt co-operation between the access points in the cell-free MIMO 
architecture. 
Cell-free with dynamic TDD provides high spectral and energy efficiency, greater reliability, 
increased coverage probability, macro-diversity gain, interference suppression, and simple 
signal processing. This makes it suitable for next-generation indoor and hot-spot coverage 
scenarios, such as a smart factory, train/metro stations, small villages, shopping complexes, 
stadiums, hospitals, college campuses, etc. and critical outdoor coverage scenarios, such as a 
connected and autonomous vehicles, etc.
This research work presents the hardware implementation of cell-free and dynamic TDD 
using the OpenAirInterface 5G new radio software stack, with the aim to experimentally 
understand the role of cell-free and dynamic TDD in providing better connectivity at the celledge and improving network throughput.
It was a joint project with Sanjhi Gupta. My role in the project was to implement cell-free 
architecture with distributed processing, configuration of dynamic TDD and integration of 
cell-free and dynamic TDD system.
The prototype of cell-free with dynamic TDD on 5G Testbed was successfully established and 
the measurements of individual setups for cell-free and dynamic TDD shows improvement 
over cellular network
