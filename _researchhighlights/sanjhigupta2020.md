The transforming telecommunication sector moves towards adopting the fifth generation 
(5G) of wireless networks in the near future featuring high data rates and low latency 
communication. However, in traditional cellular network, the cell-edge user experiences 
degraded quality of service compared to cell-center user due to the effect of the 
propagation environment on wireless transmission. In addition to that, the inter-cell 
interference from neighboring base stations further lowers the received signal power at the 
cell edge. This results in the variation of data rates among users at the cell edge and those 
near the cell center, which degrades the overall system performance. Cell-free is considered 
to be a beneficial technology as it allows each user to be jointly served by multiple base 
stations, therefore reducing the path loss effects and inter-cell interference for a user at a 
significant distance from any base station. 
Apart from poor performance at cell-edge, the network capacity in cellular network is often 
underutilized due to a static TDD configuration along with varying traffic demands in 
neighboring cells. Dynamic TDD is a promising technology to handle heterogeneous traffic 
demands, in which neighboring cells can schedule slots in the uplink/downlink directions 
depending on their local traffic demands, independent of each other. Nevertheless, a new 
challenge of cross-link interference between the base stations and user devices arises in 
dynamic TDD system which can be substantially mitigated on combining cell-free 
architecture with dynamic TDD because of the presence of in-built cooperation.
The combined system offers several advantages such as providing uniform service in an area 
and improvement in spectral and energy efficiency. The system finds its application in 
advanced areas such as connected and autonomous vehicles, where the cell edge coverage 
is crucial in terms of reliability to ensure safety. Besides, the system can also be deployed to 
serve densely populated areas with varying UL/DL requirements, trains/metro stations, 
stadiums, concerts, shopping complexes, college campuses, etc.
This project presents the hardware implementation of cell-free and dynamic TDD using the 
OpenAirInterface 5G new radio software stack, with the objective to experimentally 
understand the role of cell-free and dynamic TDD in providing better connectivity at the celledge and improving network throughput.
It was a joint project with Himani Kamboj. My research area was to analyze the throughput,
implement cell-free architecture with centralized processing and integrate cell-free and 
dynamic TDD system.
The prototype of cell-free with dynamic TDD on 5G Testbed was successfully established and 
the measurements of individual setups for cell-free and dynamic TDD shows improvement 
over cellular network.
