[www.covid19india.org](https://www.covid19india.org)  offered a comprehensive view on the pandemic across India by providing data on confirmed cases, active and recovered cases, tests and fatalities. The portal also recently started showing vaccination administration status for single-dose and fully vaccinated.  

The website, which till now was run by volunteers based on a crowd-sourcing model, provided valuable data to the public as well as researchers studying the pandemic. **The organisers  recently announced that they would stop their operations beyond 31st October 2021.**
