   The [Centre for Networked Intelligence](https://cni.iisc.ac.in/) at [Indian Institute of Science (IISc)](https://www.iisc.ac.in/) is organizing its inaugural three-day CNI Summer School on **5-6-7th August 2021.**

The fully online Summer School will include lectures by IISc faculty members as well as hands-on lab sessions on computer networks. The lecture sessions will consist of four lectures on advanced topics in Networks and Wireless Communications and one session on IoT MAC/chip design (along with a demo). Hands-on lab sessions will be conducted using a CNI’s cloud-based online lab platform.

The Summer School is targeted at 4th Year Bachelors’/dual-degree students or Masters’/PhD programs in engineering (ECE/CS/EE or related streams). A (free) registration is required for participation in the Summer School. Lecture participation will be through Zoom.
