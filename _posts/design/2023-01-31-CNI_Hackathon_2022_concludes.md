**Another successful CNI hackathon has concluded. Congratulations to the winners!**

The CNI Hackathon 2022 sought and
attracted participation from undergraduate and master’s degree students from Indian
institutes. The participants were allowed to form teams of at most two individuals to
make their submissions. The event consisted of a Data Science challenge and an AI
challenge. The data science challenge was related to a Bengaluru Metropolitan
Transport Corporation (BMTC) dataset. The participants had to use the dataset and
create a model to estimate the travel time between different source-destination
pairs. In the AI Challenge, the participants had to create a bot to play a two-player
board game.

### Participation
The Hackathon attracted participants from institutes across India, with more than
1150 registrations. In the data science challenge, 15 teams made valid submissions.
On the other hand, in the AI challenge, we saw higher participation, with 74 teams
making valid submissions. Overall, these teams comprise more than 150 individuals
from some of the well-known institutes in India.

### Evaluation Strategy 
- Data Science Challenge: The models were evaluated based on their performance on a test dataset. The better models had lower L1 errors in the travel time predictions.
- AI Challenge: The models were evaluated based on their performance on a test dataset. The better models had lower L1 errors in the travel time predictions.
- Jury presentation: The models were evaluated based on their performance on a test dataset. The better models had lower L1 errors in the travel time predictions.

The jury comprised experts from industry and IISc, and final jusy presentations were
held on January 19, 2023.
