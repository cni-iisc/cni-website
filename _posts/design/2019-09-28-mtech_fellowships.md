Applications are invited from second year Masters students (all course and research streams) in the Division of EECS for a Scholarship Programme under the forthcoming Centre for Networked Intelligence (a Cisco CSR Initiative).  Six scholarship awards are available under this programme for 2019-2020.

Full-time EECS second year masters students (one year completed in programme), not already sponsored and not already having another similar named scholarship, are eligible to apply.

The broad areas of masters research include technologies for networked intelligence (e.g. smart cities, autonomous systems, IoT/CPS systems involving sensing, communication, computation and control). The scholarship will be for the duration 01 October 2019 (tentative) to 30 June 2020 or completion of the programme (research students), whichever is earlier. The evaluation committee will look at the quality of the application and the relevance of the proposed research to the centre’s objective of showcasing innovative applications or theories of networked intelligence. (See below for some information on the Centre).

The stipend will be Rs 20,000 per month and will be in lieu of the MHRD stipend. Some financial support for travel (upto Rs 1 lakh of which 60% can be used for partial funding of international travel) and a contingency grant (upto Rs 40,000) are available. Exact amounts will be indicated at the time of award of scholarship to the selected candidates. 
The following material should be included in the application package. A single PDF document with size limit (3 MB) that includes:
1. Covering letter indicating how your work relates to networked intelligence systems and the Centre’s areas of interest (see below).
2. CV including marks or grades  in Bachelors, other degrees, years of graduation, honours and awards, publications, coursework completed, grades, work experience, etc.
3. A two-page write-up on your research area — include a short review, broad problem statement, proposed scope and focus. Include any results already obtained and papers published.

The application **email** with a single PDF document as attachment (size at most 3 MB) has to be forwarded by the adviser and should reach Mr. Subramani M.K ([subramanimk@iisc.ac.in](subramanimk@iisc.ac.in)) **on or before 14-10-2019 (IST)**.
