to apply. Longer duration (semester-long) graded intewrnships are preferred.

The selected interns will work on one of the following: (a) Sustainable computing for model-training and inference in machine learning (ML), (b) Distributed ML over heterogeneous compute environments, and (c) Network transport protocols optimized for Data Center workloads.

**Please note that we do not have any projects on applying machine learning (ML/AI) models and developing ML applications. Please apply only if you are passionate about experimental research in computer networks, operating systems, computer architecture, and performance engineering.**

Applicants must possess solid quantitative skills and must be well-acquainted with programming, systems architecture (Linux operating system, shell commands and scripting, networks, and computer architecture). Above all, they must have a flair for self-learning new techniques during the course of the internship.

The research internship in our research group follows a goal-driven intensive schedule, aith an
aim of achieving research publications and working prototypes. Please apply only if you are
willing to put in additional efforts in learning required skills and delivering on
the planned experiments. The reward is the authorship on the publication(s) and
