Sanjhi is an M.Tech (Communication and Networks) student in ECE department. Her research work is aimed to establish an experimental prototype and evaluate the possible performance enhancement of cell-free distributed MIMO system using the OpenAirInterface built-in emulation platform which provides open source implementations of 5G-NR protocol stack meeting the 3GPP specifications. The system can be used to mitigate the cell-edge effects caused by path-loss and inter-cell interference by allowing the user-equipment to connect to multiple base-stations irrespective of the cell boundary, all of which serves the user in a coordinated manner.  Hence, the system provides uniformly good service for all users in addition to greater reliability and large energy efficiency.

### Sujata Sinha
#### Advisor: A. Chockalingam (ECE)
Sujata is an Mtech (research) student in ECE department. She is currently working on designing and simulating Orthogonal Space-Time Frequency (OTFS) modulation for Visible Light Communications in an indoor local area network environment. OTFS is 2D signalling technique which effectively tackles the high mobility issues in time-varying wireless communications. The setup uses low-cost Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) and Photodetectors (PD) for transmitters and receivers using visible light spectrum (wavelength: 400 – 700 nm) which is available in abundance at no cost, without the need for licensing, no radiation issues and provides inherent security in closed room application. Also, using white light, it can simultaneously be used for data transmission and lightening.
