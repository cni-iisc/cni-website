Based on several assumptions and simplifications, they have developed a stochastic model for a WiFi network with a general layout and interactions. In spite of the assumptions and simplifications, such a model captures the complexities of the interactions between the nodes, which determine the performance, and the model could be useful in developing QoS control algorithms that dynamically set the node to transmit powers and the carrier-sense thresholds.

Based on several assumptions and simplifications, they have developed a stochastic model for a WiFi network with a general layout and interactions. In spite of the assumptions and simplifications, such a model captures the complexities of the interactions between the nodes, which determine the performance, and the model could be useful in developing QoS control algorithms that dynamically set the node to transmit powers and the carrier-sense thresholds.
