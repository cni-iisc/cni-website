However, in many real-life applications, the agents are also required to satisfy certain constraints specified on their actions. Under this setting, the objective of the agents is to not only learn the actions that optimize the common objective but also meet the specified constraints. In recent times, the Actor-Critic algorithm with an attention mechanism has been successfully applied to obtain optimal actions for RL agents in multi-agent environments. In this work, we extend this algorithm to the constrained multi-agent RL setting. KEYWORDS Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning; Attention Mechanism ACM Reference Format: P.

One approach to satisfy the constraints is to construct a modified cost as a linear combination of the original cost and the constraint costs. However, the weights to be associated with the costs are not known upfront and need to be learned in a trial-and-error fashion. We alleviate this problem by considering the Lagrangian formulation of the problem and training dual Lagrange parameters that act as weights for the constraint costs. In this work, we propose an Actor-Critic algorithm for computing the optimal actions for agents that makes use of the attention mechanism. A brief overview of the comparison of our work with other works in the literature is provided in Table 1. ∗Equal contribution by the first three authors. Full paper is available at [20].

Here,</dt> <dt>𝑛 denotes the number of agents in the environment, 𝑆 = 𝑆1 × 𝑆2 ×</dt> <dt>· · · 𝑆𝑛 is the joint state space, 𝐴 = 𝐴1 × · · · × 𝐴𝑛 denotes the joint</dt> <dt>action space and 𝑇 is the probability transition matrix. Single-stage</dt> <dt>cost function (𝑘) where 𝑘 (𝑠, 𝑎) denotes the cost incurred when joint</dt> <dt>action 𝑎 is taken in state 𝑠. Moreover, 𝑐1, . . . , 𝑐𝑚 denote the singlestage cost functions for the constraints. Note that both the main</dt> <dt>cost function (𝑘) and constraint costs (𝑐1, . . . , 𝑐𝑚) depend on the</dt> <dt>joint action of the agents. Finally, 𝛾 denotes the discount factor.</dt> <dt>Let 𝜋𝑖</dt> <dd>𝑆𝑖 −→ Δ(𝐴𝑖) denote the policy of agent 𝑖, where for a given state of agent 𝑖, 𝜋𝑖(𝑠𝑖) is a probability distribution over its actions. We now define the total discounted cost (𝐽) for a joint policy 𝜋 = (𝜋1, . . . , 𝜋𝑛) as follows: 𝐽 (𝜋) = 𝐸 hÕ𝜏 𝑡=0 𝛾 𝑡 𝑘 (𝑠𝑡 , 𝜋 (𝑠𝑡))i , (1) where 𝐸[.] is the expectation over the entire trajectory of states with initial state 𝑠0 ∼ 𝑑0, where 𝑑0 is a given probability distributionover states, 𝜏 is a finite stopping time and 𝑠𝑡 is the joint state at time 𝑡. The 𝑚 constraints on the system are defined as follows: 𝐸 hÕ𝜏 𝑡=0 𝛾 𝑡 𝑐𝑗 (𝑠𝑡 , 𝜋 (𝑠𝑡))i ≤ 𝛼𝑗 , ∀𝑗 ∈ 1, . . . ,𝑚, (2) where 𝛼1, . . . , 𝛼𝑚 are pre-specified thresholds. The objective of the agents in the multi-agent constrained cooperative RL setting is to compute a joint policy 𝜋 ∗ = (𝜋 ∗ 1 , . . . , 𝜋∗ 𝑛 ) that is the solution to the optimization problem min 𝜋 ∈Π 𝐽 (𝜋) = 𝐸 hÕ𝜏 𝑡=0 𝛾 𝑡 𝑘 (𝑠𝑡 , 𝜋 (𝑠𝑡))i (3) s.t 𝐸 hÕ𝜏 𝑡=0 𝛾 𝑡 𝑐𝑗 (𝑠𝑡 , 𝜋 (𝑠𝑡))i ≤ 𝛼𝑗 , ∀𝑗 ∈ 1, . . . ,𝑚, where Π is the set of all joint policies. We make use of Lagrangian approach to solve this constrained problem. The pseudo-code of our proposed algorithm is described in Algorithm 1.

The objective of the agents is to navigate towards the targets in a co-operative manner such that all targets are covered. The length of each episode is 25 time steps and the single-stage cost at each time step is the sum of the distance to the nearest agent, over all the targets. Therefore, the agents have to learn to navigate towards the targets in such a way that all target positions are covered. However, we include a single-stage penalty of 1 when there is a collision between the agents (and 0 otherwise). The penalty threshold (𝛼) is set to 3 in our experiments. This means that the expected total penalty over all the episodes must be less than or equal to 3. The discount factor is set to 0.99. We refer to the main cost that the agents are minimizing as ‘cost’ and the constrained cost as the ‘penalty’. For comparison purposes, we also implement the constrained version of MADDPG [16] algorithm, which we refer to as ‘MADDPG-C’. Moreover, to better analyze the results, we also report the results on an un-constrained version of Multi-agent Attention Actor-Critic [13] where there is no penalty incurred for collisions among the agents, which we simply refer to as ‘Unconstrained’.</p> <p>3.1 Discussion</p> <p>In Figure 1a, we observe that the total cost approaches convergence for all the three algorithms. The ‘Unconstrained’ algorithm achieves the smallest average cost as there is no penalty for collisions in this case. Therefore, the agents can move freely in the continuous space and navigate quickly towards the targets. This can also be observed in Figure 1b, where we see that the average penalty of the ‘Unconstrained’ algorithm is the highest. In Figure 1b, we see that the average penalty comes down as the training progresses for the constrained algorithms (MADDPG-C and our proposed MACAAC), while for the ‘unconstrained’ algorithm it almost remains constant. This is the effect of Lagrange parameters that are learnt in the constrained setting.
