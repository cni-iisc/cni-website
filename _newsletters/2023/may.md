msg-title: From the convenor

msg-content: "We are starting this monthly newsletter to keep all the stakeholders updated on the centre activities. 

Apart from the research and development activities, the centre offers free online courses, scholarship for students working in the relevant areas, organises weekly seminar series, technical workshops, and annual summer schools. 

We hope to reach students, faculty, and potential staff who would be interested in participating in the centre activities. "

CNI had organised three seminars organised in May 2023.  

Dr. Nicolas Gast, a research scientist at Inria (Grenoble, France) spoke on mean-field vontrol for restless bandits and weakly coupled MDPs. He discussed mean field control in relation to Restless Bandits and weakly coupled Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). The talk highlights the challenges in solving such problems and introduces the concept of mean-field approximations to treat every agent as independent. The talk outlines various classical notions of index policies, including the Gittins index policy, as well as lambda-threshold policies that can be used to prioritize which arms to activate. Dr. Gast explained that index policies are the best approach for solving exponential convergence problems due to their greater accuracy and locally linear nature.  He also discussed the Markovian bandit problem in the context of the job applicant selection process. He explained that simple policies like priority rules are often asymptotically optimal and can be computed easily using index policies. The talk also covered the optimality guarantees for the Mean-Field Control in Restless Bandits and Weakly Coupled MDPs, and the issue of periodic behavior and synchronization between agents in the model. He showed that the optimization results still hold, even if the Markov chain doesn't have a stationary distribution, as long as the policy does not change. Overall, the talk emphasizes the practical applications of mean-field control in solving complex and computationally challenging problems.
    
Shweta Jain,a professor  from IIT Ropar spoke on fair clustering: Notations and algorithms. She talked about a problem called "fair clustering" where we want to make sure that each group in a cluster has an equal representation of different types of people. She proposed a new way of measuring fairness called "Ï„-ratio fairness" which allows for a better balance between efficiency and fairness. She also suggested a simple algorithm that can efficiently achieve this balance. The experimental results show that this algorithm outperforms other existing algorithms.
    
Kshitiz Bansal , Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of California, San DiegoThe UC San Diego spoke on reliable object detection and identification in adverse conditions.  He mainly focused on the topic of reliable object detection and identification for autonomous driving, particularly in adverse weather conditions. He discussed the challenges posed by poor visibility due to fog or dust, and the use of different types of sensors such as cameras, lidars, and millimeter wave radars, which operate at a different spectrum and can penetrate obstacles, providing high-quality data that enhances the semantic understanding of the scene. The speaker also explained the use of techniques such as "quantillism" for radar output and object detection using deep learning networks, and how radar and camera data can be combined using image segmentation and SPG techniques for a more efficient and complete system. He also discussed the importance of scene context, CDMA phones, and multiple sensors for object detection and identification, highlighting the versatility and usefulness of RADAR sensors due to their ability to diffract from edges and detect objects in adverse conditions.
