msg-title: From the convenor

msg-content: "We are starting this monthly newsletter to keep all the stakeholders updated on the centre activities. 

Apart from the research and development activities, the centre offers free online courses, scholarship for students working in the relevant areas, organises weekly seminar series, technical workshops, and annual summer schools. 

We hope to reach students, faculty, and potential staff who would be interested in participating in the centre activities. "

CNI had organised five seminars organised in April 2023.
    
Dr. Sanjay Shakkottai, a professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in the University of Texas at Austin spoke on the power of adaptivity in representation learning:- from meta-learning to federated learning. In particular, he talked about a central problem in machine learning. The problem
is as follows: How should we train models using data generated from a collection
of clients/environments if we know that these models will be deployed in a new
and unseen environment? In the setting of few-shot learning, two prominent approaches are: (a) develop a modeling framework that is “primed” to adapt, such
as Model Adaptive Meta Learning (MAML), or (b) develop a common model
using federated learning (such as FedAvg), and then fine tune the model for the
deployment environment. The speaker talked about both these approaches in
the multi-task linear representation setting. He showed that the reason behind
the generalizability of the models in new environments trained through either
of these approaches is that the training dynamics induce the models to evolve
toward the common data representation among the clients’ tasks.
    
Avhishek Chatterjee ,an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras spoke on converse for quantum fault-tolerance.He talked about how to make quantum computers work better by reducing errors. He showed that there is a minimum amount of extra information needed to make sure that quantum operations are accurate, and he explained how to calculate this amount. He also showed that this minimum amount of extra information can help us figure out how much noise a quantum computer can handle before it stops working properly.Overall, he provided new insights into how to make quantum computers more reliable, which is important for developing practical applications of quantum computing.
    
Dr. Lalitesh Katragadda from CMU spoke on Aarogya Setu, how India saw covid. Aarogya Setu was an experimental digital effort launched in India to provide clarity, first response and see the spread of Covid. It was abandoned when needed, but did a lot of good and evolved into a trusted, high fidelity global standard vaccine response. This talk will take a walk down memory lane.
    
Manjesh Kumar Hanawal, an associate professor in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay spoke on learning optimal beam directions in next-generation wireless networks: A fixed-budget stochastic bandit approach.He talked about how we can use millimeter wave (mmWave) communications in 5G networks to support high data rates. However, these communications are sensitive to attenuation loss and require precise beam alignment between the transmitter and receiver.He proposed an algorithm called Unimodal Bandit for Best Beam (UB3) that can help identify the best beam in a finite time using pure exploration strategies. This algorithm can improve the throughput of the network by more than 15% compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms. The algorithm is simple to implement and has lower computational complexity, making it a practical solution for beam alignment in mmWave systems. His works can be useful for wireless network protocol design and can help improve the performance of 5G networks.
    
Praveen Jayachandran from IBM Research, India spoke on trends and challenges in multi-cloud networking and observability. Enterprises are deploying applications across an increasingly large number of
public, private and edge clouds. He highlighted some of the trends
in this space and the challenges it poses on multi-cloud networking and observability across these geo-distributed Cloud environments. Specifically, the
talk  explored the challenges and approaches in supporting “application-aware”
network connectivity across heterogeneous cloud environments, leveraging Observability and AI-based operational analytics. The speaker also discussed how
insights derived from analytics could assist intelligent automation for managing
applications communicating across heterogeneous multi-cloud environments.
