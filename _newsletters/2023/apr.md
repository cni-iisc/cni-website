msg-title: From the convenor

msg-content: "We are starting this monthly newsletter to keep all the stakeholders updated on the centre activities. 

Apart from the research and development activities, the centre offers free online courses, scholarship for students working in the relevant areas, organises weekly seminar series, technical workshops, and annual summer schools. 

We hope to reach students, faculty, and potential staff who would be interested in participating in the centre activities. "

CNI had organised five seminars organised in April 2023.
    
Dr. Sanjay Shakkottai, a professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in the University of Texas at Austin spoke on the power of adaptivity in representation learning:- from meta-learning to federated learning. In particular, he talked about a central problem in machine learning. The problem
is as follows: How should we train models using data generated from a collection
of clients/environments if we know that these models will be deployed in a new
and unseen environment? In the setting of few-shot learning, two prominent approaches are: (a) develop a modeling framework that is “primed” to adapt, such
as Model Adaptive Meta Learning (MAML), or (b) develop a common model
using federated learning (such as FedAvg), and then fine tune the model for the
deployment environment. The speaker talked about both these approaches in
the multi-task linear representation setting. He showed that the reason behind
the generalizability of the models in new environments trained through either
of these approaches is that the training dynamics induce the models to evolve
toward the common data representation among the clients’ tasks.
    
Avhishek Chatterjee ,an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras spoke on converse for quantum fault-tolerance. He talked about the fundamental lower bound on redundancy required
for accurate implementation of a large class of operations, including unitary
operators, in fault-tolerant quantum computation. The speaker obtained this
bound by connecting fault-tolerant computation with a set of finite blocklength
quantum communication problems whose accuracy requirements satisfy a joint
constraint.The lower bound on redundancy obtained here leads to a strictly
smaller upper bound on the noise threshold for non-degradable noise. He also
showed that their bound directly extends to the case where noise at the outputs
of a gate are non-i.i.d. but noise across gates are i.i.d. Overall, he provided
new insights into the minimum redundancy required for fault-tolerant quantum
computation, which has practical implications for designing and implementing
quantum computing systems.
    
Dr. Lalitesh Katragadda from CMU spoke on Aarogya Setu, how India saw covid. Aarogya Setu was an experimental digital effort launched in India to provide clarity, first response and see the spread of Covid. It was abandoned when needed, but did a lot of good and evolved into a trusted, high fidelity global standard vaccine response. This talk will take a walk down memory lane.
    
Manjesh Kumar Hanawal, an associate professor in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay spoke on learning optimal beam directions in next-generation wireless networks: A fixed-budget stochastic bandit approach. He talked about using millimetre wave (mmWave) communications in
5G networks, which can support high data rates but are sensitive to attenuation loss and require precise beam alignment between transmitter and receiver.
The speaker discussed Unimodal Bandit for Best Beam (UB3) algorithm that
identifies the best beam in a finite time using pure exploration strategies. The
algorithm exploits the unimodal structure of the received signal strengths of
the beams to identify the best beam with a high probability in a few rounds.
He proved that the error exponent in the probability does not depend on the
number of beams and shows that this is indeed the case by establishing a lower
bound for the unimodal bandits.He concluded that UB3 outperforms the stateof-the-art algorithms and has lower computational complexity.
    
Praveen Jayachandran from IBM Research, India spoke on trends and challenges in multi-cloud networking and observability. Enterprises are deploying applications across an increasingly large number of
public, private and edge clouds. He highlighted some of the trends
in this space and the challenges it poses on multi-cloud networking and observability across these geo-distributed Cloud environments. Specifically, the
talk  explored the challenges and approaches in supporting “application-aware”
network connectivity across heterogeneous cloud environments, leveraging Observability and AI-based operational analytics. The speaker also discussed how
insights derived from analytics could assist intelligent automation for managing
applications communicating across heterogeneous multi-cloud environments.
