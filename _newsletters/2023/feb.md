msg-content: "We are starting this monthly newsletter to keep all the stakeholders updated on the centre activities. 

Apart from the research and development activities, the centre offers free online courses, scholarship for students working in the relevant areas, organises weekly seminar series, technical workshops, and annual summer schools. 

We hope to reach students, faculty, and potential staff who would be interested in participating in the centre activities. "

CNI had organised four seminars organised in February 2023.  

Dr. Sagar Gubbi Venkatesh from Google research spoke on UI grounded instruction following on Feb 7.   In particular, he talked about the natural language-based instruction following agent that helps new smartphone users learn how to use the phone independently. The proposed system parses instructions from support sites using large language models such as ChatGPT and generates macros which can be executed when the user asks queries.
 
V. Arvind Rameshwar, a PhD candidate at ECE, IISc spoke on construction of coding schemes for binary-input channels with constrained inputs. The focus was on two different channel models, one with a random noise and another with adversarial noise. In each setting, the main questions sought to be addressed were the construction of explicit coding schemes and the derivation of good bounds on the rates achievable for a given amount of noise.  

Professor Sandip Chakraborty from the CSE department of IIT Kharagpur, spoke on RF beyond communication, exploring new opportunities for human sensing with mmWave. In this talk, the speaker discussed how mmWave sensing could be leveraged to develop smart space, where the environment can sense the human beings within it and respond accordingly.

He also discussed specific use cases, like how your car can seamlessly monitor the dangerous driving behaviours of its driver and respond accordingly without requiring any camera or sensors to be deployed on the drivers body. 

Professor Prashanth L.A. from the CSE department of IIT Madras spoke on finite-time analysis of temporal difference learning with linear function approximation with tail averaging and regularisation. This talk considered the finite-time behaviour of a popular temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm when combined with tail-averaging. The speaker also talked about the finite-time bounds on the parameter error of the tail-averaged TD iterate under a step size choice that does not require information about the eigenvalues of the underlying matrix used in the TD fixed point.
