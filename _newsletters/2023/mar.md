msg-title: From the convenor

msg-content: "We are starting this monthly newsletter to keep all the stakeholders updated on the centre activities. 

Apart from the research and development activities, the centre offers free online courses, scholarship for students working in the relevant areas, organises weekly seminar series, technical workshops, and annual summer schools. 

We hope to reach students, faculty, and potential staff who would be interested in participating in the centre activities. "

CNI had organised five seminars organised in March 2023.  
    
Yunus Inan , a PhD student at EPFL, Switzerland spoke on age-distortions tradeoffs. He talked about how to send data in the most efficient way possible. Sometimes, it's important to send data quickly, but other times it's more important to make sure the data is accurate. He looked at how to balance these two things. It uses a method called dynamic programming to find the best way to send data. He also explained how to use this method to find the best way to send data in different situations.
    
Muhammad Shahbaz, an assistant professor in Computer Science at Purdue University spoke on fast, flexible, and intelligent next-generation networks and systems. He discussed some of the networking and systems architectures he has             developed to address the ever-rising tension between  performance and flexibility. He discussed how the continuous growth in chips’ processing capacity has         helped preserve the end-to-end principle, keeping CPUs generalpurpose and smart while having network switches fixed-function and dumb, to process and forward       information at speed. However, two major trends are now challenging this principle: Moore’s Law’s decline and big data’s rise. As a result, CPUs must now           repurpose resources needed for general-purpose processing to logic tailored to a particular application domain, and switches must take on more responsibilities     to further offload CPUs. The concern is that doing  so  will cause systems to sacrifice flexibility for higher performance, and networks to sacrifice               performance for more flexibility.
    
Dr. Naga Bhushan , VP of Technology Qualcomm spoke on leading the core-technology innovations for 6G. He talked about the role of wireless AI, advanced coding, modulation & multi-access, advanced duplexing, high-           frequency bands (including subTHz), Advanced MIMO (Mega/super-massive MIMO, LoS-MIMO), multi-hop topologies (smart-repeater, intelligent reflective surfaces),     and so on. 6G wireless systems promise to deliver a transformational impact on various spheres of economic activity, including automobile, manufacturing,           industrial (IoT), agriculture,  social/ecological sustainability, healthcare, smart cities and so on. In this talk, he talked about some of the core               technologies and features of the air-interface, that provide these capabilities.
    
Sudhir Dixit spoke on research challenges in network slicing in 5G and beyond its implications on rural connectivity. He introduced the concept of network slicing and presented an overview of its current status. A number of key research challenges are discussed.       This is followed by a discussion on its positive implications to bridge the digital divide and present the business implications for the infrastructure and         service providers.
    
Parthajit Mohapatra , an assistant professor at the department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Tirupati spoke on short packet communication under random arrival of data. He talked on improving communication between devices when there is interference from other devices. The speaker explained a scenario where two devices are trying to communicate with each other, but there is interference from other devices. He showed different ways to reduce the interference and improve the communication. He found that a method called joint decoding can work better than other methods when the communication rate is low. He also looked at how stable the communication is, which means how often the devices can successfully communicate without errors. Overall, he provided insights into how to improve communication in situations where there is interference.
