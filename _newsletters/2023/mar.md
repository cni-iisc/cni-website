msg-title: From the convenor

msg-content: "We are starting this monthly newsletter to keep all the stakeholders updated on the centre activities. 

Apart from the research and development activities, the centre offers free online courses, scholarship for students working in the relevant areas, organises weekly seminar series, technical workshops, and annual summer schools. 

We hope to reach students, faculty, and potential staff who would be interested in participating in the centre activities. "

<!-- Main article -->
    CNI had organised five seminars organised in March 2023.  
    
    Yunus Inan , a PhD student at EPFL, Switzerland  talked about a model to study the tradeoff between timeliness adistortion in data transmission, where             different pieces of data have a differen cost of not being sent. He poses the question of finding the optimal tradeoff as a policy design problem                   amenable to dynamic programming methods. The speaker talked about the structural properties of optimal transmission policies, gives an algorithmic procedure to     find the optimal tradeoff, and numericall evaluates some instances.
    
    Muhammad Shahbaz, a  assistant professor in Computer Science at Purdue University ,  discussed some of the networking and systems architectures he has             developed to address the ever-rising tension between  performance and flexibility. He discussed how the continuous growth in chips’ processing capacity has         helped preserve the end-to-end principle, keeping CPUs generalpurpose and smart while having network switches fixed-function and dumb, to process and forward       information at speed. However, two major trends are now challenging this principle: Moore’s Law’s decline and big data’s rise. As a result, CPUs must now           repurpose resources needed for general-purpose processing to logic tailored to a particular application domain, and switches must take on more responsibilities     to further offload CPUs. The concern is that doing  so  will cause systems to sacrifice flexibility for higher performance, and networks to sacrifice               performance for more flexibility.
    
    Dr. Naga Bhushan , VP of Technology Qualcomm ,talked about the role of wireless AI, advanced coding, modulation & multi-access, advanced duplexing, high-           frequency bands (including subTHz), Advanced MIMO (Mega/super-massive MIMO, LoS-MIMO), multi-hop topologies (smart-repeater, intelligent reflective surfaces),     and so on. 6G wireless systems promise to deliver a transformational impact on various spheres of economic activity, including automobile, manufacturing,           industrial (IoT), agriculture,  social/ecological sustainability, healthcare, smart cities and so on. In this talk, he talked about some of the core               technologies and features of the air-interface, that provide these capabilities.
    
    Sudhir Dixit , introduced the concept of network slicing and presented an overview of its current status. A number of key research challenges are discussed.       This is followed by a discussion on its positive implications to bridge the digital divide and present the business implications for the infrastructure and         service providers.
    
    Parthajit Mohapatra , an assistant professor at the department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Tirupati,  discussed about the             performance of short packet communications over interference-limited scenarios under channel uncertainty. Specifically, it focuses on the two-user Gaussian Z-     interference channel under a finite blocklength coding regime. He characterizes the average error and throughput of the twouser Z-interference channel for         different schemes in a Rayleigh fading scenario. Additionally, he considers the stability region as a metric, which is characterized using the                     probability of successful decoding at the receivers. The average error developed for the different interference mitigation techniques under the finite             blocklength coding helps to obtain the stability region. The speaker concluded that even for the weak interference regime, the joint decoding scheme could         perform better than the treating interference as a noise scheme for low rates.
