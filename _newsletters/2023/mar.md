msg-title: From the convenor

msg-content: "We are starting this monthly newsletter to keep all the stakeholders updated on the centre activities. 

Apart from the research and development activities, the centre offers free online courses, scholarship for students working in the relevant areas, organises weekly seminar series, technical workshops, and annual summer schools. 

We hope to reach students, faculty, and potential staff who would be interested in participating in the centre activities. "

CNI had organised five seminars organised in March 2023.  
    
Yunus Inan , a PhD student at EPFL, Switzerland spoke on age-distortions tradeoffs. He talked about how to send data in the most efficient way possible. Sometimes, it's important to send data quickly, but other times it's more important to make sure the data is accurate. He looked at how to balance these two things. It uses a method called dynamic programming to find the best way to send data. He also explained how to use this method to find the best way to send data in different situations.
    
Muhammad Shahbaz, an assistant professor in Computer Science at Purdue University spoke on fast, flexible, and intelligent next-generation networks and systems. He discussed some of the networking and systems architectures he has             developed to address the ever-rising tension between  performance and flexibility. He discussed how the continuous growth in chips’ processing capacity has         helped preserve the end-to-end principle, keeping CPUs generalpurpose and smart while having network switches fixed-function and dumb, to process and forward       information at speed. However, two major trends are now challenging this principle: Moore’s Law’s decline and big data’s rise. As a result, CPUs must now           repurpose resources needed for general-purpose processing to logic tailored to a particular application domain, and switches must take on more responsibilities     to further offload CPUs. The concern is that doing  so  will cause systems to sacrifice flexibility for higher performance, and networks to sacrifice               performance for more flexibility.
    
Dr. Naga Bhushan , VP of Technology Qualcomm spoke on leading the core-technology innovations for 6G. He discussed the development of 6G wireless technology and its potential impact on various economic sectors such as automobile, manufacturing, healthcare, and smart cities. The speaker talked about the core technologies and features of the air-interface that enable these capabilities, including wireless AI, advanced coding, modulation and multi-access, high-frequency bands, advanced MIMO, and multi-hop topologies. In summary, the speaker explored the advancements in wireless technology that could revolutionize various industries and improve our daily lives.
    
Sudhir Dixit spoke on research challenges in network slicing in 5G and beyond its implications on rural connectivity. He discussed the concept of network slicing, which allows for multiple logical networks on the same physical infrastructure, creating a network of networks. The technology has significant implications for connectivity in rural areas, providing greater flexibility and efficiency.Network slicing can allow for more efficient and targeted use of resources, providing better connectivity for remote communities, especially in applications such as telemedicine and online education. However, there are challenges, including the need to ensure the right resources are available to each slice and the importance of proper management, particularly in rural areas where connectivity is limited,reliability and security still need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of network slicing in these contexts. Despite challenges, there is a lot of opportunity for improvement and innovation in network slicing.
    
Parthajit Mohapatra , an assistant professor at the department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Tirupati spoke on short packet communication under random arrival of data. He talked on improving communication between devices when there is interference from other devices. The speaker explained a scenario where two devices are trying to communicate with each other, but there is interference from other devices. He showed different ways to reduce the interference and improve the communication. He found that a method called joint decoding can work better than other methods when the communication rate is low. He also looked at how stable the communication is, which means how often the devices can successfully communicate without errors. Overall, he provided insights into how to improve communication in situations where there is interference.
