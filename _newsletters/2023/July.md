past_events_headline: We had one in-person seminar last month. We had two major  events last month. The [14th annual JTG/IEEE Information Theory Society summer school] was conducted in the ECE department at IISc from June 19-23. Apart from this, we had the bi-annual Cisco-IISc day on June 27, where all CNI PhD scholars  presented their research work, along with two associated CNI faculty. Our CSR partner Cisco  also presented their research at this event.

<!-- Main article -->

This month, we had one in-person talk.  

## Multiparty Interactive Coding over Networks of Intersecting Broadcast Links
Our first speaker this month was Manuj Mukherjee, an assistant professor in the ECE department of IIIT Delhi. He talked about how to perform computations over networks with multiple broadcast channels that intersect at a single party. Each broadcast link suffers from random bit-flip noise that affects the receivers independently. The speaker proposed interactive coding schemes that successfully perform any computation over these noisy networks and strive to reduce their communication overhead with respect to the original (noiseless) computation.
