 Contemporary challenges in wireless communication and information networks are often framed as problems of inference in large dimensional spaces. Addressing these challenges requires engineering solutions that balance performance optimization with computational efficiency. This summer program aims to lay a mathematical groundwork for innovative approaches in wireless networking. It will cover algorithmic foundations applicable across various engineering fields, such as communications, statistical signal processing, and machine learning. Participants will explore constrained minimum mean-square estimation, delve into multivariate Gaussian distributions, and gain insights into approximate message passing (AMP) algorithms which are known for their efficiency and provable performance metrics. The program will also revisit belief propagation, highlighting its theoretical basis and practical application in decoding specific error-correcting codes. Integrating these concepts, we will develop new communication algorithms tailored to single-user channels, multi-user environments, and massive machine-type communications (mMTC). If time allows, we will extend these methodologies to devise efficient strategies for cell-free systems. The overarching aim is to explore pertinent mathematical tools, apply and evaluate key concepts, and comprehend their influence on engineering practices within wireless networks and related areas.
