    The half-day workshop comprised of two 1.5 hour sessions for IT security and OT security respectively. Operational Technology (OT) cyber security and Information Technology (IT) security serve distinct purposes. OT security focuses on safeguarding critical infrastructure, ensuring safety, reliability, and availability. In contrast, IT security primarily revolves around safeguarding data, emphasizing confidentiality and integrity. OT systems utilize specialized hardware, software, and protocols tailored for industrial applications, whereas IT systems prioritize data processing, storage, and communication, emphasizing data protection and efficient management. OT systems face a range of threats from various actors, including nation-states, cybercriminals, hacktivists, and insider threats.
