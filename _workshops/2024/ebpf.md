#### One-day workshop on eBPF and its applications

eBPF Day India is being jointly organized by the eBPF Foundation and the Centre for Networked Intelligence, with support from Cisco CSR and the Indian Institute of Science.
<br>
The goal of the workshop is to spread awareness about the eBPF technology, discuss novel use cases from active industry participants, and spur discussions around how the research and developer community can leverage it for current as well as future use cases.
The workshop is open to academic/industry professionals and students. 

Participation is open to all (free registration required). The workshop will be in *hybrid mode*, i.e., you may register to attend in-person in IISc or online. 

**Brendan Gregg, Intel Fellow and the renowned author of _BPF Performance Tools_ and _Systems Performance_, is scheduled to present the keynote address in online mode.**
<br>
**Industry experts, actively working on eBPF applications and frameworks, will deliver the sessions in-person.**

The topics covered include
- Introduction to eBPF
- eBPF use cases
